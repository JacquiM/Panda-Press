# A Comparison Between UiPath and Power Automate

Automation is becoming a hot topic in conversations about the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) and fifth industrial revolution (5IR). Automation is referred to as the use of technology to replace human labour or even work alongside people in some way, leading to some sort of benefits (or saving) of having automation implemented.

Automation comes in different forms, shapes and sizes with a lot of emphasis placed on Business (or Digital) Process Automation (BPA/DPA) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

## Market Position and Maturity

While RPA is focused on mimicking a person's actions, behaviour and decisions, BPA and DPA are focused on automating business processes with specific focus on efficiency and optimisation.

**UiPath** was identified by Gartner as a leading RPA technology in 2020 and 2021 with **Microsoft** also identified as a leader in the RPA in 2021. Microsoft are positioning Power Automate and Power Automate Desktop as a technology stack that enables citizen RPA development.

### Timeline and Maturity

- **UiPath**: Founded in 2005 with their first desktop automation released in 2013
- **Microsoft**: First released Microsoft flow (now known as Power Automate) late in 2016
- **Power Automate Desktop**: Went into public preview in December 2020

UiPath definitely has the upper hand in maturity, in terms of the RPA offering, with Microsoft displaying much potential for growth.

## Enablement Technologies

Both UiPath and Microsoft have ensured that their automation offering forms part of a bigger picture.

### Microsoft Power Platform

Microsoft has put together the **Power Platform** (comprised of Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate as well as Power Virtual Agents) which integrates well into the rest of the Microsoft technology stack (from O365 right through to Azure).

Microsoft has also made sure not to exclude any major third party technology stacks as integration points into the Power Platform.

### UiPath Automation Suite

UiPath have led their offering along a similar trajectory, ensuring that they have multiple products that allow developers to adequately develop artefacts throughout the hyperautomation lifecycle.

- **Cross-platform** requirements
- **Advanced testing** needs
- **Scalable automation** architectures

### Hybrid Approach
Many enterprises successfully use **both platforms**:
- **Power Automate** for Microsoft ecosystem integration
- **UiPath** for complex RPA scenarios
- **Complementary capabilities** rather than competing solutions

## Future Considerations

### Power Automate Evolution

- Enhanced AI capabilities through Azure
- Improved citizen developer experience
- Desktop automation maturity

### UiPath Development
- Expanded cloud-native capabilities
- Enhanced AI and ML integration
- Improved developer experience
- Broader platform integrations

The choice between platforms often depends on existing technology investments, automation complexity requirements, and organizational structure for citizen vs. professional development approaches. Both platforms continue to evolve rapidly, making regular evaluation beneficial for long-term automation strategies.
