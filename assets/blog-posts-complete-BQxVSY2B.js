# Unit Testing in Power Automate Flows

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, helping developers ensure that individual components of their code function as expected. But what about when you're working with low-code or no-code automation platforms like Power Automate? Can you apply the same principles of unit testing to ensure the reliability and robustness of your automated workflows?

## Understanding Unit Testing in Automation Context

### Traditional Unit Testing
In traditional software development, unit testing involves:
- Testing individual functions or methods in isolation
- Validating expected outputs for given inputs
- Ensuring code reliability before integration
- Automated test execution and validation

### Power Automate Testing Challenges
- **Visual workflows**: Tests must account for flow-based logic
- **External dependencies**: APIs, databases, and services
- **Asynchronous operations**: Time-dependent processes
- **Limited testing frameworks**: Fewer built-in testing tools

## Testing Strategy Framework

### 1. Test Planning and Design

Before building flows, define your testing approach:

\`\`\`json
{
    "TestPlan": {
        "Scope": "Individual flow components and actions",
        "Objectives": [
            "Validate data transformation logic",
            "Confirm error handling behaviour",
            "Verify condition and branching logic",
            "Test integration points"
        ],
        "TestData": "Prepared datasets for various scenarios"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Component Isolation

Identify testable components within your flows:
- **Data operations**: Transformations, filtering, calculations
- **Condition logic**: If/else branches and switch statements
- **API calls**: External service integrations
- **Error handling**: Exception and retry logic

## Implementation Techniques

### Test Flow Creation

Create dedicated test flows for each component:

\`\`\`json
{
    "TestFlow_DataTransformation": {
        "Purpose": "Test customer data parsing logic",
        "Inputs": [
            {"CustomerData": "John,Doe,john@email.com,Manager"},
            {"CustomerData": "Jane,Smith,jane@email.com,Developer"}
        ],
        "ExpectedOutputs": [
            {"FirstName": "John", "LastName": "Doe", "Email": "john@email.com", "Role": "Manager"},
            {"FirstName": "Jane", "LastName": "Smith", "Email": "jane@email.com", "Role": "Developer"}
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Mock Data Implementation

Use SharePoint lists or Excel tables for test data:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Test data structure
TestCustomers = [
    {ID: 1, Name: "Test Customer 1", Email: "test1@email.com", Active: true},
    {ID: 2, Name: "Test Customer 2", Email: "test2@email.com", Active: false},
    {ID: 3, Name: "Invalid Customer", Email: "", Active: true}
];
\`\`\`

### Assertion Implementation

Create validation logic within test flows:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ValidationStep": {
        "Condition": "@equals(outputs('DataTransform')?['Email'], variables('ExpectedEmail'))",
        "TrueAction": "Log success and continue",
        "FalseAction": "Log failure and alert team"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Testing Patterns

### 1. Parameterised Testing

Create flexible test flows that accept multiple test cases:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ParameterisedTest": {
        "ForEach": "@variables('TestCases')",
        "Actions": {
            "ExecuteTest": "@item()?['TestAction']",
            "ValidateResult": "@equals(outputs('ExecuteTest'), item()?['ExpectedResult'])",
            "LogResult": "@if(body('ValidateResult'), 'PASS', 'FAIL')"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Integration Testing

Test complete workflows with external dependencies:

\`\`\`json
{
    "IntegrationTest": {
        "Setup": "Create test environment and data",
        "Execute": "Run complete business process",
        "Validate": "Check all expected outcomes",
        "Cleanup": "Remove test data and restore state"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Error Scenario Testing

Specifically test error handling and edge cases:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ErrorScenarios": [
        "Invalid input data",
        "Network connectivity issues", 
        "Authentication failures",
        "Rate limiting responses",
        "Unexpected data formats"
    ]
}
\`\`\`

## Test Automation and CI/CD

### Automated Test Execution

Schedule regular test runs:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ScheduledTesting": {
        "Trigger": "Recurrence - Daily at 2 AM",
        "Actions": [
            "Execute all unit test flows",
            "Collect results in test report",
            "Send summary to development team",
            "Update test dashboard"
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Test Reporting

Create comprehensive test reports:

\`\`\`json
{
    "TestReport": {
        "TestRun": "@utcNow()",
        "TotalTests": "@length(variables('TestResults'))",
        "PassedTests": "@length(filter(variables('TestResults'), equals(item()?['Status'], 'PASS')))",
        "FailedTests": "@length(filter(variables('TestResults'), equals(item()?['Status'], 'FAIL')))",
        "Coverage": "@div(variables('TestedComponents'), variables('TotalComponents'))"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization
- **Naming conventions**: Clear, descriptive test flow names
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive test case documentation
- **Version control**: Track test flow versions with main flows
- **Environment separation**: Dedicated testing environments

### 2. Data Management
- **Test data isolation**: Separate test data from production
- **Data cleanup**: Automated cleanup after test execution
- **Data variance**: Multiple scenarios and edge cases
- **Data security**: Anonymised or synthetic test data

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Test failure alerts**: Immediate notification of test failures
- **Performance monitoring**: Track test execution times
- **Trend analysis**: Monitor test success rates over time
- **Dashboard integration**: Visual test status representation

## Common Testing Scenarios

### Data Validation Testing
\`\`\`json
{
    "EmailValidation": {
        "TestCases": [
            {"Input": "valid@email.com", "Expected": true},
            {"Input": "invalid-email", "Expected": false},
            {"Input": "", "Expected": false}
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

### API Integration Testing
\`\`\`json
{
    "APIResponseTesting": {
        "MockResponses": [
            {"StatusCode": 200, "Body": "{success: true}"},
            {"StatusCode": 404, "Body": "{error: 'Not found'}"},
            {"StatusCode": 500, "Body": "{error: 'Server error'}"}
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Business Logic Testing
\`\`\`json
{
    "DiscountCalculation": {
        "TestCases": [
            {"OrderValue": 100, "CustomerTier": "Gold", "ExpectedDiscount": 15},
            {"OrderValue": 50, "CustomerTier": "Silver", "ExpectedDiscount": 10},
            {"OrderValue": 25, "CustomerTier": "Bronze", "ExpectedDiscount": 5}
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

# Getting Data from the 'New' GitHub Projects API

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

GitHub Projects is nothing new – it has been around for a while now with a really cool API that allows you to pull data from it. For those who have made use of that functionality, it has been a breeze trying to automate and integrate different tasks across development workflows.

However, GitHub's "new" Projects experience (Projects V2) introduced significant changes to the API structure and capabilities, offering enhanced flexibility and more powerful automation possibilities.

## Understanding GitHub Projects V2

### Key Differences from Classic Projects
- **Enhanced data model**: More flexible field types and relationships
- **Improved API structure**: GraphQL-based with better query capabilities  
- **Advanced automation**: Richer workflow triggers and actions
- **Better integration**: Seamless connection with GitHub ecosystem

### API Architecture
The new GitHub Projects API uses GraphQL, providing:
- **Precise data fetching**: Request exactly the data you need
- **Reduced API calls**: Combine multiple requests into single queries
- **Real-time updates**: Efficient subscription mechanisms
- **Type safety**: Strongly typed schema definitions

## Getting Started with the API

### Authentication Setup

\`\`\`javascript
// Using GitHub Personal Access Token
const headers = {
    'Authorization': \`Bearer \${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}\`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'GraphQL-Features': 'projects_next_graphql'
};
\`\`\`

### Basic Project Query

\`\`\`graphql
query GetProject($projectId: ID!) {
    node(id: $projectId) {
        ... on ProjectV2 {
            id
            title
            description
            url
            createdAt
            updatedAt
            owner {
                ... on Organization {
                    login
                }
                ... on User {
                    login
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Core API Operations

### 1. Fetching Project Data

\`\`\`javascript
async function getProjectData(projectId) {
    const query = \`
        query($projectId: ID!) {
            node(id: $projectId) {

                                }
                                ... on PullRequest {
                                    title
                                    state
                                    author {
                                        login
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    \`;
    
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({
            query,
            variables: { projectId }
        })
    });
    
    return response.json();
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Adding Items to Projects

\`\`\`javascript
async function addIssueToProject(projectId, issueId) {
    const mutation = \`
        mutation($projectId: ID!, $contentId: ID!) {
            addProjectV2ItemById(input: {
                projectId: $projectId
                contentId: $contentId
            }) {
                item {
                    id
                }
            }
        }
    \`;
    
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({
            query: mutation,
            variables: {
                projectId,
                contentId: issueId
            }
        })
    });
    
    return response.json();
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Updating Field Values

\`\`\`javascript
async function updateProjectItem(projectId, itemId, fieldId, value) {
    const mutation = \`
        mutation($projectId: ID!, $itemId: ID!, $fieldId: ID!, $value: ProjectV2FieldValue!) {
            updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
                projectId: $projectId
                itemId: $itemId
                fieldId: $fieldId
                value: $value
            }) {
                projectV2Item {
                    id
                }
            }
        }
    \`;
    
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({
            query: mutation,
            variables: {
                projectId,
                itemId,
                fieldId,
                value
            }
        })
    });
    
    return response.json();
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Automated Project Updates

\`\`\`javascript
// Webhook handler for issue events
app.post('/webhook/issues', async (req, res) => {
    const { action, issue, repository } = req.body;
    
    if (action === 'opened') {
        // Automatically add new issues to project
        await addIssueToProject(PROJECT_ID, issue.node_id);
        
        // Set initial status
        await updateProjectItem(
            PROJECT_ID,
            itemId,
            STATUS_FIELD_ID,
            { singleSelectOptionId: BACKLOG_OPTION_ID }
        );
    }
    
    if (action === 'closed') {
        // Update status to completed
        await updateProjectItem(
            PROJECT_ID,
            itemId,
            STATUS_FIELD_ID,
            { singleSelectOptionId: DONE_OPTION_ID }
        );
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('OK');
});
\`\`\`

### Reporting and Analytics

\`\`\`javascript
async function generateProjectReport(projectId) {
    const projectData = await getProjectData(projectId);
    const items = projectData.data.node.items.nodes;
    
    const report = {
        totalItems: items.length,
        byStatus: {},
        byAssignee: {},
        completionRate: 0
    };
    
    items.forEach(item => {
        // Analyse status distribution
        const status = getFieldValue(item, 'Status');
        report.byStatus[status] = (report.byStatus[status] || 0) + 1;
        
        // Analyse assignee workload
        if (item.content.assignees) {
            item.content.assignees.nodes.forEach(assignee => {
                report.byAssignee[assignee.login] = 
                    (report.byAssignee[assignee.login] || 0) + 1;
            });
        }
    });
    
    // Calculate completion rate
    const completed = report.byStatus['Done'] || 0;
    report.completionRate = Math.round((completed / items.length) * 100);
    
    return report;
}
\`\`\`

### Bulk Operations

\`\`\`javascript
async function bulkUpdateItems(projectId, updates) {
    const promises = updates.map(update => 
        updateProjectItem(
            projectId,
            update.itemId,
            update.fieldId,
            update.value
        )
    );
    
    // Execute with concurrency limit
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
    
    const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;
    const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length;
    
    return { successful, failed, total: updates.length };
}
\`\`\`

## Power Platform Integration

                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Power Apps Integration

\`\`\`powerapps
// Function to fetch GitHub project data
FetchGitHubProject() = 
    With(
        {
            Response: PowerApps.HTTPRequest(
                "POST",
                "https://api.github.com/graphql",
                {
                    "Authorization": "Bearer " & GitHubToken,
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                },
                JSON({
                    query: GitHubProjectQuery,
                    variables: { projectId: ProjectId }
                })
            )
        },
        ParseJSON(Response.Body)
    );
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### API Rate Limiting
- **Monitor usage**: Track API quota consumption
- **Implement caching**: Store frequently accessed data
- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple updates efficiently
- **Use webhooks**: Prefer event-driven updates over polling

### Error Handling
\`\`\`javascript
async function safeApiCall(operation, retries = 3) {
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
        try {
            return await operation();
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempt === retries) throw error;
            
            // Exponential backoff
            await new Promise(resolve => 
                setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000)
            );
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Security Considerations
- **Token management**: Secure storage and rotation
- **Webhook validation**: Verify payload signatures
- **Access control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Audit logging**: Track all API interactions

## Common Use Cases

### Team Productivity Tracking
- Monitor sprint progress and velocity
- Identify bottlenecks in development workflow
- Generate automated status reports
- Track individual and team contributions

### Release Management
- Coordinate feature releases across projects
- Automate deployment pipeline triggers
- Manage rollback procedures
- Track release metrics and success rates

### Customer Support Integration
- Link customer issues to development work
- Prioritise bug fixes based on customer impact
- Automate escalation procedures
- Generate customer communication updates

# Building Successful Custom Training Programmes

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organisations must invest in continuous learning to remain competitive. Generic training solutions often fall short of addressing specific business needs, making customised training programmes essential for success.

## Understanding Your Training Needs

Before designing any training programme, it's crucial to conduct a thorough needs assessment:

### Assessment Framework:
1. **Current Skill Gap Analysis** - Identify specific technical competencies your team lacks
2. **Business Objective Alignment** - Ensure training supports strategic goals
3. **Learning Style Preferences** - Understand how your team learns best
4. **Resource Availability** - Assess time, budget, and infrastructure constraints

## Key Components of Effective Training

### Practical, Hands-On Learning
Our experience shows that theoretical knowledge must be complemented with practical application. Participants learn best when they can immediately apply new concepts to real-world scenarios.

### Customised Content Development
Every organisation has unique challenges and requirements. Off-the-shelf training materials rarely address specific business contexts, workflows, and systems that learners encounter daily.

### Ongoing Support and Mentorship
Learning doesn't end when the formal training session concludes. Successful programmes include:
- Post-training support channels
- Regular check-ins and progress assessments
- Access to subject matter experts
- Community forums for peer learning

## Measuring Training Success

Effective measurement goes beyond simple satisfaction surveys:

- **Knowledge Retention Testing** - Assess learning outcomes over time
- **Performance Improvement Metrics** - Track productivity gains
- **Application Success Rates** - Monitor how effectively participants apply new skills
- **Return on Investment** - Calculate training value against business outcomes

## Industry-Specific Considerations

Different industries require tailored approaches:

### Financial Services
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Risk management protocols
- Security-first development practices

# Integrating with the MusicMaker Bot on Discord Using UiPath

Discord is a great place to get a community of like-minded people together to partake in a whole range of activities, from gaming and home automation to Q&A community forums right across to using educational forums and everything in between. The more informal options often have text or voice channels that have Bots connected to provide some entertainment, in the form of music.

Many Bots have been written for exactly this purpose. My favourite one, so far (mostly because it was the easiest for me to get to work) is [MusicMaker](https://top.gg/bot/774043716797071371). Although there are many music bots, very few actually support YouTube, which is quite peculiar.

![Discord Automation with UiPath](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## The Challenge

The problem though, is that MusicMaker doesn't play an existing YouTube playlist, it requires you to create your own. So to use MusicMaker, I actually had to create a playlist and add the songs from my YouTube playlist, one-by-one. This was very VERY tedious and so, I decided to automate as much of it as possible.

I started off by automating the [YouTube Playlist Extraction](https://www.nuget.org/packages/YouTube.Playlists) and popped it into a reusable library. Then I created a UiPath solution that allows me to execute a few different MusicMaker functions through Discord.

## The Solution

"MusicMaker on Discord" is an attended automation solution that allows for the following functionality:

- Add MusicMaker to a Discord Server
- Create a playlist
- Add music to a playlist from a YouTube playlist
- Play a playlist

Each .xaml file can be run individually and the process prompts the user for inputs and provides instructions through message boxes to ensure that everything works the way it should.

![UiPath Discord Integration Process](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-8.png)

## Add MusicMaker Bot to Server

First thing's first… Before we can use MusicMaker on Discord, we need to ensure that a few things have already been setup:

- A Discord server has been created
- The appropriate channels and help text have been added to the server to welcome users

Once the server has been set up, the MusicMaker Bot needs to be added to the server. To use the MusicMaker Bot, **the bot should be referenced in a voice channel** using the designated list of commands recognised by [MusicMaker](https://discordbotlist.com/bots/musicmaker).

### Available Commands

\`\`\`
/back | /statistic | /clear | /dj | /filter | /help | /loop | /nowplaying | /pause | /ping | /play | /playlist | /queue | /resume | /save | /search | /skip | /stop | /time | /volume
\`\`\`

As such, the UiPath process prompts you to connect to a voice channel on the Discord server and open the chat. **If the chat is not open, the UiPath process will not work as it is intended to work.** Once you are ready, with an open chat on the connected voice channel, you can click OK on the prompt raised by the UiPath process after which it will continue executing the commands to add MusicMaker to the server.

## Create Playlist

Once the MusicMaker bot has been added to the server, you can start interacting with the bot. You can either play music on a song-by-song basis or you can play a playlist, which is ideal if the music will be playing in the background with little interaction needed.

The problem though, is that playing a playlist does not mean that you will be playing an existing playlist from an existing music provider. The playlist command refers specifically to a MusicMaker playlist, which means that you need to create a new playlist on MusicMaker if you don't already have one.

### Required Inputs

The command requires two pieces of input:

- **Playlist Name**: The name of the playlist you'd like to create
- **Public**: A boolean (true or false) value that indicates whether or not the playlist should be made available publicly

> **Note**: If you elect to make this value false, only you will be able to play the playlist from the server (which everyone else on the channel will still be able to hear). Only the creator of a private playlist can command MusicMaker to play the playlist. If it is public, anyone on the channel can start the playlist.

Once again, for the UiPath process to work, the prompts need to be followed and the instructions need to be executed as per the instructions before hitting 'OK'. The prompts are set to instruct you to open the Discord app, connect to a voice channel and open the chat so that the UiPath process can work.

## Add Music from YouTube Playlist

This may take some work before getting up and running. In order for this to work in UiPath, Python would need to be installed and the Python interpreter path would need to be provided, along with the Google API key to access YouTube.

Here's a [guide on how to get the API key](https://thejpanda.com/2021/01/21/automation-youtube-playlist-monitoring-using-python/). The "add music to a MusicMaker playlist from a YouTube playlist" workflow makes use of a custom built [YouTube Playlists package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/YouTube.Playlists/), available through NuGet.

### Configuration Requirements

You'll be prompted for the following values:

- **Developer Key**: Google Developer Key associated to the YouTube API V3
- **Playlist Name**: The name of the playlist you'd like to add songs to

You'll need to assign values to the following variables which are not prompted for:

- **File Path**: The path that the Excel file should be written to and read from
- **Playlist ID**: The ID of the YouTube playlist to be scraped

In essence, all that is really needed here is an Excel file listing the songs, so if you'd rather write a UI automation component to get the list from YouTube, that'd work too.

Once the Excel spreadsheet has been generated, the song title is extracted from each row and added to the playlist.

## Play Playlist

Last thing left on the list, is to actually play the playlist. The process prompts you for input and instructs you to open the Discord server, connect to a voice channel and open the chat before proceeding. You'll only be prompted to input the **Playlist Name.**

The bot will then add the command into the chat and the playlist will start playing.

![MusicMaker Bot Vote Request](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-9.png)

If, at any point, the above message pop into the chat, click on the link, vote for MusicMaker and go about your business, everything will keep working.

## Technical Implementation

The solution leverages several key technologies:

1. **UiPath Studio** - For process automation and UI interaction
2. **YouTube API V3** - For playlist data extraction
3. **Python Integration** - For YouTube data processing
4. **Custom NuGet Package** - For reusable YouTube functionality
5. **Discord Bot Commands** - For MusicMaker interaction

## Best Practices

When implementing this automation:

- Ensure proper error handling for network connectivity issues
- Implement retry logic for Discord API interactions
- Validate YouTube playlist accessibility before processing
- Use proper authentication for all external services
- Test with different playlist sizes and formats

## Source Code

The solution is open for contribution through [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/JacquiM/MusicMaker-on-Discord).

# Getting Data from the 'New' GitHub Projects - Automation and Web Scraping

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

![GitHub Projects Automation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

GitHub Projects is nothing new – it has been around for a while now with a really cool API that allows you to pull data from it. For those who have made use of that functionality, it has been a breeze trying to automate and integrate different tasks across different platforms. But… GitHub have launched an 'all-new' project element to their platform that now allows you to do cool new things that was previously limited in the Classic Projects.

![GitHub New Projects](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image.png)

Now from an automation and integration perspective, this addition is exciting but getting the data is notoriously tough. The addition to the platform is still relatively new and hasn't been out of preview for all that long so it is understandable that the API (which is based on Graph QL) is not quite 'there' yet. It's not as easy as lifting and shifting from Classic Projects to new Projects. So what now? How do we use this cool new (free) tech and still be able to grab the data we need if not even front-end Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can work?

The answer didn't seem as 'simple' at the time, when I had exhausted nearly every possible solution I could think of, but web-scraping definitely does the trick.

Due to the way that GitHub (and GitHub Projects – more specifically) has been created, a lot of the data that is being rendered on the front-end is actually quite easily accessible from the front-end elements of the web page which is why the web-scraping option works so well. The only caveat is that you need to have access to the Project to scrape it.

Here are a few examples of the data you can pull:

- Project Views
- Project View Columns
- Project View Data
- Project Charts

You can pull individual elements and associated data out as well (like list of values for a specific column, etc.). Let's see how that works using Python.

## Install Beautiful Soup

If you haven't yet installed [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), do so using the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
\`\`\`

## Import Libraries

Import all of the following libraries/packages which are essential to the successful scraping of the data:

\`\`\`python
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs 
\`\`\`

## Use Beautiful Soup to Scrape the Project

Beautiful Soup is the packaged used to scrape a web page which, in this case, works quite well when scraping a GitHub project. The soup is the content scraped from the webpage and will be used further for more manipulation to get the required data.

\`\`\`python
def GetProjectSoup(project_url):
    # load the projectpro webpage content 
    r = requests.get(project_url) 
    # convert to beautiful soup 
    soup = bs(r.content) 
    return soup
\`\`\`

## Get Project Views

All the required data already lives in the 'soup' – all you need to do is grab the data living in the 'memex-views' element:

\`\`\`python
def GetViews(soup):
    view_data_text = str(soup.find_all(id='memex-views')).replace('[<script id="memex-views" type="application/json">','').replace('<\/script>]','')
    json_object = json.loads(view_data_text)
    return pd.DataFrame.from_dict(json_object)
\`\`\`

## Get Project View Columns

All the required data already lives in the 'soup' – all you need to do is grab the data living in the 'memex-columns-data' element:

\`\`\`python
def GetColumns(soup):
  
    column_data_text = str(soup.find_all(id='memex-columns-data')).replace('[<script id="memex-columns-data" type="application/json">','').replace('<\/script>]','')
    json_object = json.loads(column_data_text)
    json_object
    return pd.DataFrame.from_dict(json_object)
\`\`\`

## Get View Data

All the required data already lives in the 'soup' – all you need to do is grab the data living in the 'memex-items-data' element:

\`\`\`python
def GetData(soup):
  
    data_text = str(soup.find_all(id='memex-items-data')).replace('[<script id="memex-items-data" type="application/json">','').replace('<\/script>]','')
    json_object = json.loads(data_text)
    json_object
    df_tempdata = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(json_object)
    return df_tempdata
\`\`\`

## Get Project Charts

All the required data already lives in the 'soup' – all you need to do is grab the data living in the 'memex-charts-data' element:

\`\`\`python
def GetCharts(project_url):
    # load the projectpro webpage content 
    r = requests.get(project_url) 
    # convert to beautiful soup 
    soup = bs(r.content) 
    #print(soup)
    column_data_text = str(soup.find_all(id='memex-charts-data')).replace('[<script id="memex-charts-data" type="application/json">','').replace('<\/script>]','')
    json_object = json.loads(column_data_text)
    json_object
    charts_list = [ element['name'] for element in json_object]
    return charts_list
\`\`\`

## Bringing it all Together

It is totally possible to scrape more data from the site, all you would need to do is rescrape the new URL which you can put together based on some of the info you've already scraped, like appending '/views/<index>' to the project URL to get specific view data.

\`\`\`python
project_url = 'https://github.com/users/JacquiM/projects/23/views/1'
# Get Soup from Website Scrape
soup = GetProjectSoup(project_url)
# Get Views and assign to new Dataframe
df_views = GetViews(soup)
# Get Columns and assign to new Dataframe
df_columns = GetColumns(soup)
# Get View Data and assign to new Dataframe
df_data = GetData(soup)
# Get Project Charts and return as List
charts_list = GetCharts(project_url)
\`\`\`

All the code that you would need can be found in this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JacquiM/GitHub-Project-Scrape). This approach provides a practical workaround for accessing GitHub's new Projects data when traditional API methods aren't sufficient.

## Key Benefits

- **No API limitations**: Bypass GraphQL complexity
- **Real-time data**: Access current project state
- **Comprehensive extraction**: Get views, columns, data, and charts
- **Flexible implementation**: Customise based on specific needs

## Considerations

- **Access requirements**: Must have project access permissions
- **Rate limiting**: Implement appropriate delays between requests
- **Structure changes**: Monitor for GitHub UI updates that might affect scraping
- **Authentication**: Handle private repositories appropriately

This web scraping approach fills the gap while GitHub's new Projects API matures, providing developers with the automation capabilities needed for modern project management workflows.`,date:"2025-03-13",category:"Custom Development",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"12 min read",slug:"github-projects-data-automation",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image.png"},{id:"7",title:"Download Files from Google Drive in C#",excerpt:"Simple and efficient method to download files from Google Drive using C# HttpClient, with support for both file streams and memory streams.",content:`
# Download Files from Google Drive in C#

There are multiple ways to download files from Google Drive, some of which require authentication and others that require lots of code. Here's the simplest way to download the files, [provided you've got the right file url](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-direct-link-google-drive-files/).

![Google Drive Integration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## Simple File Download Implementation

The most straightforward approach uses the Google Drive direct download URL format and C# HttpClient:

\`\`\`csharp
var url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=<file_id>";
var path = "<add temp file path where file should be downloaded>";

using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    using (var s = client.GetStreamAsync(url))
    {
        using (var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
        {
            s.Result.CopyTo(fs);
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Memory Stream Alternative

The above approach also works when writing to **memory stream**, instead of copying to a file stream, copy to a new MemoryStream variable:

\`\`\`csharp
var url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=<file_id>";

using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    using (var s = client.GetStreamAsync(url))
    {
        using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
        {
            s.Result.CopyTo(ms);
            // Process the memory stream as needed
            return ms.ToArray(); // If you need byte array
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Getting the File ID

To use this method, you need to extract the file ID from your Google Drive file URL. The file ID is the long string of characters in your Google Drive URL after \`/d/\` and before \`/view\`.

For example, if your Google Drive URL is:
\`\`\`
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/view
\`\`\`

The file ID would be:
\`\`\`
1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms
\`\`\`

## Advanced Implementation with Error Handling

For production use, consider adding proper error handling and async/await pattern:

\`\`\`csharp
public async Task<byte[]> DownloadGoogleDriveFileAsync(string fileId)
{
    var url = $"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id={fileId}";
    
    try
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            var response = await client.GetAsync(url);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            
            return await response.Content.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();
        }
    }
    catch (HttpRequestException ex)
    {
        throw new Exception($"Failed to download file from Google Drive: {ex.Message}", ex);
    }
}
\`\`\`

## File Sharing Requirements

For this method to work, ensure that:

1. The Google Drive file is shared publicly or with link sharing enabled
2. The file permissions allow download access
3. The file is not too large (Google Drive has size limits for direct downloads)

## Use Cases

This simple approach is perfect for:

- **Automation scenarios** where you need to download configuration files
- **Data integration** workflows that process files from Google Drive
- **Content management** systems that cache remote files
- **Backup solutions** that download files for local storage

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

- Only works with publicly accessible files or files with link sharing
- Large files may require additional handling for Google Drive's virus scan warning
- No built-in retry logic for network failures
- Does not handle Google Drive's download quotas

This straightforward method provides an efficient way to integrate Google Drive file downloads into your C# applications without the complexity of full OAuth authentication workflows.`,date:"2023-01-05",category:"Automation",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Beginner",slug:"google-drive-file-download-csharp",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"8",title:"Low-Code Development Trends for 2024",excerpt:"Exploring the latest trends in low-code development and how they're transforming business applications.",content:`

# Creating a Full Outer Join Between Collections in Power Apps

**Level of Difficulty: Intermediate – Senior**

![Power Apps Collections](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

To join or not to join! Let's delve deep into the realm of data manipulation by introducing the concept of a "full join" and how to implement it between two collections in Power Apps.

If you come from a database background, the term 'full join' might be familiar. For those new to this concept, a full outer join returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right collection. This is particularly useful when you need to combine datasets whilst preserving all data from both sources.

![Join Types Diagram](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1.png)

When you have two datasets (collections in Power Apps) that contain data, you may have a scenario where you need to extract data from both sets, depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of your scenario. In the image above, the blue represents the data you would like to extract based on the criteria you are using and the nature of the join you are executing.

## Understanding Full Joins in Power Apps Context

In traditional database systems, a full outer join would return:
- All records from the left table
- All records from the right table  
- Matched records from both tables

Power Apps collections work similarly, but require a different approach since there's no built-in full join function.

In this context, to join two tables (or collections) in Power Apps to collect all data from both collections, you'd be executing a "full outer join" equivalent query to collect the joining of two collections (col_Source and col_Destination – on the Id column) into one big collection (col_FullOuterJoin) where you can manipulate and update the columns needed in the joined collection (col_FullOuterJoin).

## Implementation Code

Here's the code to implement a full outer join in Power Apps:

\`\`\`powerapps
Collect(col_FullOuterJoin,
    // Iterate through all source records and join to destination collection
    ForAll(
        // Iterate through the source collection
        col_Source,
        {
            // Create a item for each mapped source and destination record
            // Find the corresponding destination record
            col_Destination: Filter(col_Destination, Id = ThisRecord.Id),
            col_Source: ThisRecord,
            // Columns to appear in dataset
            Code: ThisRecord.Code,
            Name: ThisRecord.Name,
            // Conditioned Columns - Use logic from one collection to set the value
            Status: If(
                    (ThisRecord.RiskScore)<=100, "Low",
                    (ThisRecord.RiskScore)>100 And (ThisRecord.RiskScore)<150, "Medium",
                    (ThisRecord.RiskScore)>=150, "High")
        }
    )
);
\`\`\`

The join above should result in the following:

![Join Results](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joins.png)

## Advanced Techniques

### Using Patch for Dynamic Updates

For real-time applications, you might want to update the join dynamically:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Dynamic update function
UpdateFullJoin() = 
    ClearCollect(FullJoinResult,
        // Your full join logic here
    );
\`\`\`

### Handling Multiple Join Conditions

When you need to join on multiple fields:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Multiple condition join
Filter(SalariesCollection, 
    EmployeeID = ID && 
    Department = Department
)
\`\`\`

## Performance Considerations

- **Collection Size**: Full joins can be expensive with large datasets
- **Indexing**: Ensure your join fields are properly structured
- **Caching**: Consider caching results for frequently accessed joins

## Common Use Cases

1. **Employee Management**: Combining employee data with salary information
2. **Inventory Systems**: Matching products with stock levels
3. **Customer Analytics**: Joining customer data with transaction history
4. **Project Management**: Combining project details with resource allocation

## Best Practices

- Always validate your data before performing joins
- Handle null values appropriately
- Test with sample data first
- Document your join logic for team members
- Consider alternative approaches for very large datasets

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue**: Missing records after join
**Solution**: Verify your join conditions and check for data type mismatches

**Issue**: Performance degradation
**Solution**: Optimise your filter conditions and consider breaking large operations into smaller chunks

**Issue**: Unexpected duplicates
**Solution**: Ensure your join keys are unique or implement deduplication logic

## Conclusion

Full outer joins in Power Apps require thoughtful implementation but provide powerful data combination capabilities. By understanding the underlying principles and following best practices, you can effectively merge collections whilst maintaining data integrity.

This technique opens up new possibilities for data analysis and reporting within your Power Apps solutions, making it an essential skill for intermediate to advanced developers.`,date:"2025-03-13",category:"Low-Code Solutions",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"8 min read",slug:"power-apps-full-outer-join-collections",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joins.png"},{id:"10",title:"Working With SharePoint Lookup Columns in Lists Through Power Apps",excerpt:"Master SharePoint lookup columns in Power Apps for enhanced data relationships and streamlined workflows.

# Working With SharePoint Lookup Columns in Lists Through Power Apps

**Level of Difficulty: Intermediate – Senior**

![Power Apps SharePoint Integration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

In today's dynamic digital workspace, organisations continuously seek versatile tools to enhance data interactivity and streamline workflows. Many organisations use the Microsoft suite which brings together their whole ecosystem which is generally accompanied by a SharePoint-central strategy. Citizen development and business processes largely make use of SharePoint lists and libraries to share data as well as documents.

Enter SharePoint lists with lookup columns – a powerful feature that allows lists to pull data from another list, much like how foreign keys work in relational databases. This capability not only promotes data consistency but also reduces redundancy. When integrated with Power Apps, these lookup columns can significantly elevate app functionalities (or so Microsoft says), providing users with contextually relevant data selections. However, like all tools, they come with their pros and cons. While they offer enhanced data relationships and a more structured data entry experience, they might introduce complexity for new users and could impact performance if not optimised.

Despite these challenges, when used correctly and appropriately, SharePoint lists with lookup columns in Power Apps can be a game-changer for businesses aiming for efficient and interactive data management.

I think as a community of developers, we try to stay as far away from additional complexity in SharePoint when integrating into Power Apps as possible. Lookups are therefore, not often used. So what happens when a citizen developer has created a lovely hierarchy of lists that have more lookups and relationships than a YouTube influencer has followers? You've got to make do with what you've got. Let's say there's a '**_Participant_**' list in SharePoint that has a lookup column from another list named '**_Team_**'.

## Adding a Record to the List

Here's how you'd populate the Participant list while linking it up to the correct team:

\`\`\`powerapps
Patch(
    Participants,
    {
        UserId: Office365Users.MyProfile().Id,
        Participation: "Team",
        Team:
        {
            Id: TeamID,
            Value: TeamName
        },
        Participant: Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName
    }
)
\`\`\`

**Note:** TeamID and TeamName refer to variables that were set with the Team values, retrieved through lookup expressions in Power Apps.

## Updating a Record and Removing the 'Link' Between Lists

Now let's say you've created a record where a Participant is associated to a team and then life happened, normal human drama… And that participant no longer wants to be associated to a team? What then?

Well, you'd still need to do a Patch, but you'd need to link the participant to the equivalent of "null" or "none" for the Team lookup. Here's how (use -1):

\`\`\`powerapps
Patch(
    Participants,
    LookUp(Participants,UserId= Office365Users.MyProfile().Id),
    {
        UserId: Office365Users.MyProfile().Id,
        Participation: "Individual",
        Participant: Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName,
        Team:
        {
            Id: -1,
            Value: ""
        }
    }
)
\`\`\`

Hope this helps you through the journey of using SharePoint Lists and Lookups with Power Apps!

## Advanced Lookup Techniques

### Cascading Dropdown Implementation

Create dependent dropdowns based on lookup relationships:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Parent dropdown (Categories)
Items: ProductCategories

// Child dropdown (Subcategories)
Items: Filter(
    ProductSubcategories,
    CategoryLookup.Id = CategoryDropdown.Selected.ID
);

// Final dropdown (Products)
Items: Filter(
    Products,
    SubcategoryLookup.Id = SubcategoryDropdown.Selected.ID
);
\`\`\`

### Dynamic Lookup Filtering

Implement context-sensitive lookup values:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Filter lookup based on user context
Items: Filter(
    Projects,
    Or(
        AssignedTo.Email = User().Email,
        ProjectManager.Email = User().Email,
        Department.Value = Office365Users.GetMyProfile().Department
    )
);
\`\`\`

### Lookup Column Validation

Ensure data integrity with validation rules:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Validate lookup selection
If(
    IsBlank(CustomerLookup.Selected),
    Notify("Please select a customer", NotificationType.Error),
    // Continue with form submission
    SubmitForm(CustomerForm)
);
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimisation

### Efficient Data Loading

Optimise lookup performance:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Cache lookup data
OnStart: Set(
    CachedCategories,
    SharePoint_Categories
);

// Use cached data in dropdown
Items: CachedCategories
\`\`\`

### Selective Column Retrieval

Load only necessary columns:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Specify required columns
ShowColumns(
    SharePoint_Products,
    "Title",
    "CategoryLookup",
    "Price",
    "Status"
);
\`\`\`

### Pagination for Large Lists

Handle large lookup lists efficiently:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Implement search functionality
Items: If(
    Len(SearchBox.Text) >= 3,
    Filter(
        FirstN(SharePoint_Customers, 500),
        SearchBox.text in Title Or
        SearchBox.text in CompanyName
    ),
    FirstN(SharePoint_Customers, 100)
);
\`\`\`

## Complex Scenarios

### Cross-Site Lookups

Connect data across multiple SharePoint sites:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Connection to different site
SiteB_Departments = 'Site B - Departments';

// Use in lookup dropdown
Items: SiteB_Departments
OnSelect: Set(
    SelectedDepartment,
    ThisItem
);
\`\`\`

### Lookup with Additional Columns

Display related information from lookup lists:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Show additional lookup details
LookUp(
    ProductCategories,
    ID = ThisItem.CategoryLookup.Id
).Description;

// Combine multiple lookup values
ThisItem.CategoryLookup.Value & " - " &
LookUp(
    ProductCategories,
    ID = ThisItem.CategoryLookup.Id
).Code;
\`\`\`

### Conditional Lookup Population

Populate lookups based on business rules:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Auto-populate based on conditions
If(
    User().Email in CompanyExecutives.Email,
    Set(DepartmentLookup, AllDepartments),
    Set(DepartmentLookup, Filter(
        AllDepartments,
        Manager.Email = User().Email
    ))
);
\`\`\`

## Form Integration Patterns

### New Item Forms

Handle lookup columns in creation forms:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Form validation before submit
If(
    And(
        Not(IsBlank(CustomerDropdown.Selected)),
        Not(IsBlank(ProductDropdown.Selected)),
        Not(IsBlank(PriorityDropdown.Selected))
    ),
    SubmitForm(NewOrderForm),
    Notify("Please complete all required lookup fields", NotificationType.Error)
);
\`\`\`

### Edit Forms with Lookups

Properly initialise lookup values for editing:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Set default values for edit form
Default: LookUp(
    Customers,
    ID = ThisItem.CustomerLookup.Id
);

// Handle lookup updates
OnChange: Patch(
    Orders,
    ThisItem,
    {CustomerLookup: {
        '@odata.type': "#Microsoft.Azure.Connectors.SharePoint.SPListExpandedReference",
        Id: CustomerDropdown.Selected.ID,
        Value: CustomerDropdown.Selected.Title
    }}
);
\`\`\`

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Lookup values not displaying
\`\`\`powerapps
// Solution: Check column mapping
Text(
    If(
        IsBlank(ThisItem.CategoryLookup),
        "No category assigned",
        ThisItem.CategoryLookup.Value
    )
);
\`\`\`

**Issue**: Performance problems with large lists
\`\`\`powerapps
// Solution: Implement search and pagination
Items: If(
    Len(SearchText) >= 2,
    FirstN(
        Filter(CustomersList, StartsWith(Title, SearchText)),
        50
    ),
    FirstN(CustomersList, 50)
);
\`\`\`

**Issue**: Delegation warnings
\`\`\`powerapps
// Solution: Use non-delegable functions appropriately
ForAll(
    FirstN(FilteredCustomers, 500),
    // Process each customer
);
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Normalise data structures**: Avoid data duplication
- **Plan lookup hierarchies**: Design logical relationships
- **Consider user experience**: Implement intuitive navigation
- **Maintain data quality**: Implement validation rules

### Performance Guidelines
- **Cache reference data**: Store frequently used lookups
- **Limit lookup depth**: Avoid excessive nested lookups
- **Use appropriate controls**: Choose optimal UI components
- **Monitor delegation**: Stay within delegation limits

### Maintenance Strategies
- **Document relationships**: Maintain clear documentation
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove unused lookup values
- **Version control**: Track changes to lookup structures
- **User training**: Educate users on proper usage

## Advanced Integration Scenarios

### Power BI Integration

Connect lookup data to reporting solutions:

\`\`\`powerapps
// Prepare data for Power BI
ClearCollect(
    ReportingData,
    AddColumns(
        SharePoint_Orders,
        "CustomerName", CustomerLookup.Value,
        "CategoryName", ProductLookup.CategoryLookup.Value
    )
);
\`\`\`

### Flow Integration

Trigger automated processes based on lookup changes:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Trigger": "When item is created or modified",
    "Condition": "CustomerLookup field changes",
    "Actions": [
        "Send notification to account manager",
        "Update customer interaction log",
        "Trigger follow-up workflow"
    ]
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

SharePoint lookup columns provide powerful data relationship capabilities when properly implemented in Power Apps. By understanding the various patterns, performance considerations, and best practices, developers can create sophisticated business applications that leverage the full potential of the Microsoft ecosystem.

Success with lookup columns requires careful planning, proper implementation, and ongoing maintenance. Start with simple lookup scenarios and gradually incorporate more complex patterns as your expertise grows.

Remember that effective lookup implementation enhances both user experience and data integrity, making it a critical skill for Power Apps developers working in SharePoint-centric environments.`,date:"2023-10-21",category:"Digital Transformation",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"9 min read",slug:"power-apps-sharepoint-lookup-columns",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"11",title:"Asynchronous Processing and Concurrency in Power Automate Flows",excerpt:"Master efficient and responsive automation using asynchronous processing concepts in Power Automate.

# Asynchronous Processing and Concurrency in Power Automate Flows

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

![Power Automate Automation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the need for efficient and responsive automation has never been greater. As developers and businesses strive to streamline operations, enhance user experiences, and tackle increasingly complex tasks, one key concept has emerged as a game-changer: asynchronous processing.

In this blog post, we'll dive deep into the world of asynchronous processing (specifically in Power Automate), exploring its benefits and potential pitfalls. Whether you're a developer looking to optimise workflows or a business owner seeking to boost efficiency, understanding the power of asynchronous processing can be the key to unlocking new possibilities in your digital endeavours. So, let's embark on a journey to uncover the secrets behind this essential technology and discover how it can revolutionise your approach to automation.

## What is Asynchronous Processing?

In most technology stacks, the discussion around synchronous versus asynchronous processing has been somewhat of a "no-brainer". In most cases asynchronous processing just makes more sense since the pros far outweigh the cons. But why? To understand that, we need to understand the difference between the two processing types.

In **synchronous processing**, tasks or operations are executed one after the other in a sequential manner. **Each task must complete before the next one starts**. Synchronous processing is well-suited for scenarios where tasks require immediate attention or where the order of execution is critical. It can block the user interface or system until all tasks are finished, potentially causing delays in responsiveness.

In **asynchronous processing**, tasks or operations are queued and executed in the background without blocking the main thread or system. **Tasks can run concurrently or be scheduled to run at a later time**. Asynchronous processing is beneficial for handling long-running tasks, optimising system resources, and improving user experience by preventing delays. It is commonly used for batch processing, background jobs, and scenarios where real-time interaction is not required.

![Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png)

## Asynchronous Processing in Power Automate

So how does this relate to Power Automate? Well, when working with 'Apply to each' actions in Power Automate, you can set concurrency as well as the concurrency count in the settings of the action. This is supposed to be the functionality that allows for asynchronous processing in Power Automate. For the most part, it works well. But there are also times when it falls over horribly.

![Apply to Each Concurrency Settings](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png)

## Pros of Concurrency in Power Automate

According to ChatGPT and the humans before us… There are a few very generic advantages of concurrency:

1. **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing allows you to handle a large volume of tasks or workflows without causing performance issues or delays. You can queue up tasks and let them be processed in the background, freeing up system resources for other tasks.
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users don't have to wait for long-running processes to complete before they can continue with their work. Asynchronous processing enables users to submit requests or trigger workflows and carry on with their tasks without interruption.
3. **Error Handling**: If a workflow fails during execution, asynchronous processing can provide better error handling capabilities. Failed tasks can be retried, and errors can be logged and analysed more effectively.
4. **Long-Running Workflows**: Asynchronous processing is essential for handling long-running workflows that may take hours, days, or even weeks to complete. It ensures that these workflows can run without impacting system responsiveness.
5. **Load Balancing**: By distributing workload across multiple processing nodes, asynchronous processing can help balance the load on your resources, improving overall system performance.

**But the reality of it tells a very different story…**

The only one really worth mentioning from the above is "**Long-Running Workflows**". By setting up concurrency, you're allowing your process to run at different degrees of parallelism which means that you do not need to wait for one item to be processed before the next starts. Up to 50 can be processed at the same time. This can significantly decrease the runtime of your process. But it's not quite that simple. It's all in the design and development. **Load Balancing** can arguably be seen as a disadvantage of concurrency in Power Automate as it is not a "full-proof" solution and can often result in API and action limits being hit a lot sooner. If you're working on smaller processes, load balancing is definitely something that could be realised as an advantage but as the implementations get bigger, **Scalability** is also impacted. The more you scale, the more expensive the solution would become because there's more to take into account and concurrency won't solve your problems.

## Cons of Concurrency in Power Automate

As is to be expected, ChatGPT gave some mediocre explanations of what some of the disadvantages are. Which are debatably more accurate and less conflicting than the advantages:

1. **Complexity**: Asynchronous processing can introduce complexity into your workflows, especially when dealing with dependencies between tasks or workflows. Managing the sequencing of tasks can be challenging.
2. **Delayed Results**: Since asynchronous processing involves background execution, the results of a workflow or task may not be immediately visible. Users may need to wait for notifications or check status updates to know when a task is completed.
3. **Limited Real-Time Interactivity**: Asynchronous processing may not be suitable for scenarios where real-time interaction or immediate feedback is required. It is not ideal for applications that rely on real-time responses.
4. **Resource Consumption**: While asynchronous processing can free up system resources for immediate tasks, it still requires resources to manage the queuing and execution of background tasks. This can lead to increased resource consumption.
5. **Monitoring and Debugging**: Tracking the progress of asynchronous workflows and debugging issues can be more challenging than with synchronous workflows, as you may need to rely on logging and status checks.

There are definitely scenarios where each of the above are relevant, even in the Power Automate stack. The most important would probably be the '**Complexity**' aspect. There's a lot to consider when wanting to setup concurrency. One of the biggest aspects would be from a design perspective – ensuring that you're removing nested 'apply to each' actions and removing any dependencies within the 'apply to each'. Both of these would make concurrency somewhat redundant in the solution. If we are honest, **Delayed Results** is a problem in its entirety in the Power Automate stack, when using 'Apply to each'. Regardless of whether concurrency is on or not, you need to wait for all items to be processed before the results are returned.

### 3. Batch Processing with Apply to Each

Optimise loops for concurrent execution:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ApplyToEach": {
        "Settings": {
            "ConcurrencyControl": {
                "Enabled": true,
                "DegreeOfParallelism": 4
            }
        },
        "Items": "@variables('DataCollection')",
        "Actions": {
            "ProcessItem": "Individual item processing logic"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Concurrency Patterns

### Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern

Distribute work across multiple branches and consolidate results:

\`\`\`json
{
    "FanOut": {
        "Description": "Split large dataset into chunks",
        "Implementation": {
            "ChunkSize": 100,
            "MaxConcurrency": 5,
            "ProcessingBranches": [
                "ProcessChunk1",
                "ProcessChunk2", 
                "ProcessChunk3",
                "ProcessChunk4",
                "ProcessChunk5"
            ]
        }
    },
    "FanIn": {
        "Description": "Combine results from all branches",
        "WaitFor": "All branches to complete",
        "Action": "Merge and validate results"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Producer-Consumer Pattern

Separate data generation from data processing:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Producer": {
        "Role": "Generate work items",
        "Output": "Queue of tasks to process",
        "Frequency": "Continuous"
    },
    "Consumer": {
        "Role": "Process work items",
        "Input": "Tasks from queue",
        "Concurrency": "Multiple instances"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimisation

### Concurrency Settings

Configure optimal concurrency levels:

\`\`\`json
{
    "ConcurrencySettings": {
        "ApplyToEach": {
            "DegreeOfParallelism": 4,
            "Recommendation": "Based on system capacity and external API limits"
        },
        "HTTPActions": {
            "MaxConcurrentConnections": 10,
            "Consideration": "Respect rate limiting"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Resource Management

Monitor and manage resource consumption:

- **Memory usage**: Track data volume in concurrent operations
- **API limits**: Respect rate limiting across parallel calls
- **Execution time**: Monitor for timeout scenarios
- **Error rates**: Implement proper error handling

## Error Handling in Asynchronous Flows

### Resilient Design Patterns

\`\`\`json
{
    "ErrorHandling": {
        "RetryPolicy": {
            "Count": 3,
            "Interval": "PT30S",
            "Type": "Exponential"
        },
        "TimeoutSettings": {
            "Duration": "PT10M",
            "Action": "Cancel and log error"
        },
        "FailureHandling": {
            "ContinueOnError": true,
            "LogErrors": true,
            "NotifyAdministrator": "On critical failures"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevent cascade failures in concurrent operations:

\`\`\`json
{
    "CircuitBreaker": {
        "FailureThreshold": 5,
        "TimeoutDuration": "PT5M",
        "HalfOpenRetryInterval": "PT2M",
        "Actions": {
            "Open": "Stop making calls to failing service",
            "HalfOpen": "Test if service has recovered",
            "Closed": "Normal operation"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Observability

### Performance Metrics

Track key performance indicators:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Metrics": {
        "Throughput": "Items processed per minute",
        "Latency": "Time from start to completion",
        "ErrorRate": "Percentage of failed operations",
        "Concurrency": "Number of parallel operations",
        "ResourceUtilisation": "Memory and CPU usage"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Logging and Tracing

Implement comprehensive logging:

\`\`\`json
{
    "LoggingStrategy": {
        "CorrelationId": "Track related operations",
        "Timestamps": "Precise timing information",
        "OperationContext": "Which branch/operation",
        "PerformanceData": "Execution duration and resource usage"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

\`\`\`json
{
    "DocumentPipeline": {
        "Stage1": "Receive documents in parallel",
        "Stage2": "Concurrent OCR processing",
        "Stage3": "Parallel validation and classification",
        "Stage4": "Simultaneous storage and indexing"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Multi-System Data Synchronisation

\`\`\`json
{
    "DataSync": {
        "Sources": [
            "CRM system",
            "ERP system", 
            "Marketing platform",
            "Customer support tool"
        ],
        "Process": "Concurrent data extraction and transformation",
        "Destination": "Centralised data warehouse"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Notification Broadcasting

\`\`\`json
{
    "NotificationSystem": {
        "Channels": [
            "Email notifications",
            "SMS alerts",
            "Teams messages",
            "Mobile push notifications"
        ],
        "Processing": "Parallel delivery across all channels"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### Design Considerations

- **Continuous improvement**: Regular performance optimisation

## In Conclusion…

Earlier today I ran into an issue with concurrency in Power Automate due to the architecture of Power Automate. Since you need to declare (or initialise) the variables outside of a scope, you are essentially reusing the same instance across threads. This means that if multiple threads are running at the same time, you would definitely stand the chance of suffering from a data leak as the data gets jumbled and variable values are overwritten between threads and used as is. This results in dramatically incorrect results. You won't realise that this is happening when you're processing small amounts of data to test the concept. You only really realise that this is an issue when you test with larger amounts of data. This makes debugging the problem a lot more difficult.

![Concurrency Variable Issues](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-3.png)

As such, my advice is that if you are using a global variable in your 'Apply to each', rather decrease your concurrency count or turn it off completely. You'll be sacrificing the performance of your flow but at least your output will be accurate. I do believe that this would be solved by Microsoft allowing developers the ability to initialise a new instance of a variable in each thread. But since sharing is caring, we are stuck.

So use concurrency as far as possible, until you need to use variables in your apply to each. Or until you are facing some licensing limits. Make sure your design and placement of actions allows for asynchronous processing else concurrency won't help you much (ie. nested 'apply to each' actions).`,date:"2023-11-18",category:"Low-Code Solutions",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"10 min read",slug:"power-automate-asynchronous-processing",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.png"},{id:"12",title:"Ensuring Center of Excellence (COE) Control of Apps and Automate Flows",excerpt:"Learn how to maintain governance and control over Power Platform environments, preventing orphaned artefacts and ensuring organisational oversight.",content:`
# Ensuring Center of Excellence (COE) Control of Apps and Automate Flows

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

![Power Platform Governance](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

One of the biggest challenges in the Power Platform is maintaining control of the environments with the necessary visibility, especially when faced with the risk of orphaned artefacts (apps/flows without owners – possibly because the owner has left the organisation and the user account associated no longer exists).

The solution to this would be to assign ownership of all apps and flows in an environment to a service account or user group that contains users who should have visibility of what is happening in the environment. This user group would be a group of users who do not require elevated permissions. Elevated permissions allow access to the tenant and multiple other environments which goes against the "least access necessary" principle and is a GDPR (among other compliance regulations) violation.

Assigning a group or account to the flows and apps can be done on reoccurring basis (daily reoccurrence is recommended).

![COE Solution Architecture](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/update-artefact-owner.drawio.png)

This solution does not require any additional licensing as none of the connectors are premium – all connectors used in this flow are standard connectors:

![Power Automate Flow](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/flow-2.png)

The flow above assigns groups (of users) and individual users (service principal accounts) to apps and flows. Depending on your use case, you can reduce some of the actions in the flow to only work with the roles relevant to your use case.

## Retrieve Service Account/User Group for Use

To retrieve the service account profile and/or the user group, make use of the following configuration on the relevant actions:

![User Group Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png)

## Set App Owner & Role Assignment

Once you've retrieved the user/group, you'll want to set the owner and add a role assignment per app. Which can be done as follows:

![App Owner Assignment](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.png)

The expression used to get the environment is as follows:

\`\`\`
workflow()['tags']['environmentName']
\`\`\`

The body of 'put item' is as follows:

\`\`\`json
{
  "properties/roleName": "CanEdit",
  "properties/principal/email": outputs('List_groups')?['body/value'][0]['mail'],
  "properties/principal/id": outputs('List_groups')?['body/value'][0]['id'],
  "properties/principal/type": "Group",
  "properties/principal/tenantId": items('Apply_to_each_Power_App')?['properties/owner/tenantId']
}
\`\`\`

If you are using a user instead of a group, change the principal type to 'User'.

## Modify Flow Owners

The same principle can be applied to flows.

![Flow Owner Modification](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png)

The expression used to get the environment is as follows:

\`\`\`
workflow()['tags']['environmentName']
\`\`\`

The body of 'add user item' is as follows:

\`\`\`json
{
  "properties/principal/id": outputs('List_groups')?['body/value'][0]['id'],
  "properties/principal/type": "Group"
}
\`\`\`

If you are using a user instead of a group, change the principal type to 'User'.

Your flow should now be connected correctly. Don't forget the exception handling!

# Getting Unique Records or Items from an Excel Table

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

![Power Automate Excel](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

In today's fast-paced world, managing data is important, and Excel is a common tool for organising and analysing information. Still, working with large datasets can be tough when duplicates arise. When handling a contact list, it is crucial to have unique entries. It is also important for tracking sales or analysing project results. A clean dataset helps in making good decisions.

This is where Power Automate steps in to make your life easier. With its automation capabilities, you can quickly extract unique records from an Excel table. This saves time and eliminates the need for tedious manual effort. In this post, we'll demonstrate how to utilise Power Automate. This will simplify the process and help you work smarter. It allows you to focus on what really matters. Let's get started!

## Setting the Scene

Let's say we have a spreadsheet that contains multiple records detailing the participants of a hackathon. The hackathon submissions can be submitted and presented as groups that contain multiple team members. Each team member is recorded in the spreadsheet. An automated solution is needed to notify each team of their acceptance with each member cc'ed in a mail sent to each team. The challenge is that the data requires some manipulation for the automation to be functional. What now?

## Create an Excel Spreadsheet with a Table & Data in it

Create an Excel workbook. Insert a table and add columns with corresponding data to the table:

![Excel Table Setup](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1.png)

Ensure the Excel spreadsheet is accessible from the cloud. Add it to SharePoint or OneDrive.

## Build a Power Automate Flow

Let's develop a Power Automate flow that will read the Excel spreadsheet and find a list of distinct projects from the Excel spreadsheet:

![Power Automate Flow Design](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png)

Start by listing all rows present in the table. Then select only the Projects column (or the column which you would like to get the distinct values of). Then set the **array** variable to the following:

> union(body('Select_Project_Names'), body('Select_Project_Names'))

For each project, you can now filter the results from the Excel and compile the list of email addresses to be cc'ed on the mail.

![Flow Implementation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/flow-3.png)

### Method 1: Using Select and Union Functions

\`\`\`json
{
    "Select_unique_items": {
        "inputs": {
            "from": "@body('List_rows_present_in_a_table')?['value']",
            "select": {
                "Email": "@item()?['Email']",
                "Name": "@item()?['Name']",
                "Company": "@item()?['Company']"
            }
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Method 2: Filter with Contains Function

\`\`\`json
{
    "Filter_array": {
        "inputs": {
            "from": "@body('List_rows_present_in_a_table')?['value']",
            "where": "@not(contains(variables('ProcessedEmails'), item()?['Email']))"
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Excel Table

First, establish connection to your Excel file:
1. Use "List rows present in a table" action
2. Select your Excel file and table
3. Ensure proper authentication

### Step 2: Create Tracking Variable

Initialise a variable to track processed records:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Initialize_variable": {
        "inputs": {
            "variables": [{
                "name": "UniqueRecords",
                "type": "array",
                "value": []
            }]
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Process Each Row

Apply logic to identify and process unique records:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Apply_to_each": {
        "foreach": "@body('List_rows_present_in_a_table')?['value']",
        "actions": {
            "Condition": {
                "if": "@not(contains(variables('UniqueRecords'), items('Apply_to_each')?['Email']))",
                "then": {
                    "Append_to_array_variable": {
                        "inputs": {
                            "name": "UniqueRecords",
                            "value": "@items('Apply_to_each')"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Column Uniqueness

For scenarios requiring uniqueness across multiple columns:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Compose_unique_key": {
        "inputs": "@concat(item()?['Email'], '_', item()?['Phone'], '_', item()?['Company'])"
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Handling Case Sensitivity

Implement case-insensitive comparison:

\`\`\`json
{
    "Condition_case_insensitive": {
        "if": "@equals(toLower(item()?['Email']), toLower(variables('CurrentEmail')))"
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### Data Validation
- **Pre-validation**: Check data formats before processing
- **Empty field handling**: Account for blank or null values
- **Data type consistency**: Ensure consistent data types

### Performance Optimisation
- **Batch processing**: Process large datasets in chunks
- **Indexing**: Use efficient lookup methods
- **Parallel processing**: Implement concurrent operations where possible

### Error Handling
- **Try-catch blocks**: Implement proper error handling
- **Logging**: Track processing steps and errors
- **Rollback procedures**: Plan for data recovery

## Common Scenarios

### Contact List Management
Remove duplicate contacts based on email addresses whilst preserving the most recent entry.

### Sales Data Cleanup
Eliminate duplicate transactions whilst maintaining data integrity for reporting.

### Inventory Management
Ensure unique product entries whilst handling variant information appropriately.

### Survey Response Processing
Remove duplicate survey submissions based on participant identification.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Flow runs slowly with large datasets
**Solution**: Implement pagination and batch processing

**Issue**: Some duplicates remain after processing
**Solution**: Review uniqueness criteria and data formatting

**Issue**: Original data is modified unexpectedly
**Solution**: Implement proper backup and staging procedures

## Integration Considerations

### SharePoint Lists
Combine with SharePoint for enhanced collaboration and data management.

### Teams Integration
Implement notifications for data processing completion.

### Power BI Integration
Connect cleaned datasets directly to reporting solutions.

## In Conclusion

The above "should" work. It worked for me. If it doesn't work for you, Microsoft definitely broke something and hopefully Copilot can help figure it out. I wanted to filter the array (Excel results), it showed me all of the fingers, so I had to "requery" the Excel – Copilot wasn't smart enough to get around that but hopefully you'll have better luck!

This approach provides a practical solution for extracting unique records from Excel tables using Power Automate, making it particularly useful for scenarios like hackathon participant management, contact list deduplication, and project team coordination.`,date:"2024-11-18",category:"Training & Development",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"6 min read",slug:"power-automate-excel-unique-records",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1.png"},{id:"14",title:"Basic Exception Handling in Power Automate Cloud Flows",excerpt:"Learn how to implement robust exception handling in Power Automate using Try-Catch-Finally patterns with scopes to build reliable automation workflows.",content:`
# Basic Exception Handling in Power Automate Cloud Flows

Power Automate is a powerful tool that works well for integration and even automating workflows. Citizen developers have started adopting Power Automate to automate some of their day-to-day activities. One of the most important parts of a traditional solution development strategy is error and exception handling.

![Power Automate Exception Handling](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## Understanding Exception Types

Automation would typically face two kinds of errors/exceptions:

### Application Error
An application error refers to any 'unknown' (unrelated to business rules) error that occurs within the execution of the solution. These include:
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Service unavailability
- Authentication failures
- Timeout errors

### Business Exception
A business exception refers to any scenario where the process does not meet the defined business rules that the automation was built to include. Examples include:
- Invalid data formats
- Missing required information
- Business rule violations
- Validation failures
- Approval rejections

Even as citizen development takes off, there remain to be many advantages realised by implementing exception handling. But how do we do it in Power Automate? Here's how…

## Create a Flow

Navigate to Power Automate Cloud and create a new, blank, flow. As part of the exception handling strategy, a variable, named \`varErrorOccurred\`, will be used to store a boolean value indicating that the flow either ran successfully or an error occurred, in which case the flow did not run successfully.

Scopes will be used to group process steps separately from the steps to be executed when an error occurs. This refers to the **try…catch** approach (which often includes a **finally** code block as well).

### Exception Handling Pattern
- **Try block**: Contains all of the process steps that should be executed
- **Catch block**: Contains all of the steps to be executed if an error occurs during any of the process steps
- **Finally block**: Contains steps to be executed, regardless of whether or not any exceptions occurred

## Setup Scopes for Exception Handling

Let's start by adding three scopes to the flow and name them **Try**, **Catch** and **Finally**:

![Exception Handling Scopes](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.png)

### Configure the Catch Scope

Next, the **Catch** scope should be set up to run when an error occurs in the **Try** scope. To do this:

1. Click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the **Catch** scope
2. Select **Configure Run After**

![Configure Run After](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1.png)

3. Configure to run after **is skipped**, **has failed**, and **is timed out**
4. Leave **is successful** unchecked

### Configure the Finally Scope

Then set up the **Finally** scope to run after any state by following the same steps above, but this time, for the **Finally** scope:

![Finally Scope Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-2.png)

Configure to run after all states:
- **is successful** ✅
- **is skipped** ✅
- **has failed** ✅
- **is timed out** ✅

## Implementation Best Practices

### Variable Initialisation
**Note:** You cannot yet initialise variables within a scope, variables need to be initialised at the highest level of the flow, so ensure that you add any **Initialise variables** actions before the **Try** scope.

\`\`\`
Variables to consider:
- varErrorOccurred (Boolean): Tracks if an error occurred
- varErrorMessage (String): Stores error details
- varProcessingStatus (String): Tracks current processing state
\`\`\`

### Try Scope Implementation

Within the **Try** scope, add your main business logic:

1. **Input validation** steps
2. **Main processing** actions
3. **Data transformation** steps
4. **Success indicators** (set varErrorOccurred to false)

### Catch Scope Implementation

Within the **Catch** scope, add error handling logic:

1. **Set varErrorOccurred** to true
2. **Log error details** using available outputs
3. **Send notifications** to administrators
4. **Cleanup actions** for partial processing
5. **Alternative processing** paths if applicable

### Finally Scope Implementation

Within the **Finally** scope, add cleanup and completion logic:

1. **Resource cleanup** actions
2. **Final status updates** to external systems
3. **Audit logging** regardless of success/failure
4. **Notification** of completion status

## Advanced Exception Handling Patterns

### Nested Try-Catch Blocks

For complex flows, you can implement nested exception handling:

\`\`\`
Try (Main Process)
├── Try (Sub-process 1)
├── Catch (Sub-process 1 errors)
├── Try (Sub-process 2)
├── Catch (Sub-process 2 errors)
└── Finally (Sub-process cleanup)
\`\`\`

### Retry Logic Implementation

Implement retry patterns for transient errors:

1. **Counter variable**: Track retry attempts
2. **Delay action**: Wait between retries
3. **Condition check**: Limit maximum retries
4. **Success validation**: Check if retry succeeded

### Error Classification

Categorise errors for appropriate handling:

\`\`\`
Switch (Error Type)
├── Case: "TransientError" → Retry logic
├── Case: "BusinessError" → Business exception handling
├── Case: "SystemError" → Administrative notification
└── Default: Generic error handling
\`\`\`

## Error Information Extraction

Power Automate provides error information through built-in functions:

### Available Error Properties
- \`outputs('<action_name>')\` - Get action outputs including errors
- \`body('<action_name>')\` - Extract response body
- \`actions('<action_name>')['error']\` - Get specific error details

### Example Error Handling Action

\`\`\`json
{
  "inputs": {
    "variables": [
      {
        "name": "varErrorMessage",
        "type": "String",
        "value": "@{concat('Error in action: ', actions('YourActionName')['displayName'], ' - ', coalesce(actions('YourActionName')['error']['message'], 'Unknown error'))}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Logging

### Flow Run History
- Monitor success/failure rates
- Analyse error patterns
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Track retry effectiveness

### Custom Logging
Implement custom logging to external systems:
- **Application Insights** for detailed telemetry
- **SharePoint Lists** for audit trails
- **Email notifications** for critical errors
- **Teams messages** for operational alerts

## Testing Exception Handling

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy path** - Normal successful execution
2. **Business exceptions** - Invalid data scenarios
3. **System errors** - Service unavailability
4. **Timeout scenarios** - Long-running operations
5. **Partial failures** - Mid-process errors

### Testing Techniques
- **Intentional failures** - Add test actions that always fail
- **Mock services** - Use test endpoints that return errors
- **Data variations** - Test with invalid data formats
- **Load testing** - Test under high volume conditions

## Performance Considerations

### Scope Overhead
- Scopes add minimal performance overhead
- Benefits outweigh costs for robust error handling
- Consider flow complexity vs. maintainability

### Error Handling Efficiency
- Avoid excessive error checking for known-good data
- Use parallel branches for independent operations
- Implement early exit patterns for unrecoverable errors

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering** - Don't add exception handling where simple retry would suffice
2. **Under-logging** - Ensure sufficient error information for debugging
3. **Ignoring business exceptions** - Handle expected business scenarios appropriately
4. **Poor user experience** - Provide meaningful error messages to end users
5. **Resource leaks** - Always cleanup resources in Finally scope

This exception handling pattern provides a solid foundation for building reliable and maintainable Power Automate flows that can gracefully handle both expected and unexpected error scenarios.`,date:"2022-05-04",category:"Automation",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Beginner – Senior",slug:"power-automate-exception-handling",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"15",title:"10 Tips for Optimising Power Automate Flows",excerpt:"Essential performance optimisation strategies for Power Automate flows, covering both Desktop and Cloud flows to improve execution times and reliability.",content:`
# 10 Tips for Optimising Power Automate Flows

Power Automate is a powerful tool that allows for integrations and RPA solutions to be developed through the use of Power Automate Desktop and Cloud flows. A disadvantage of using Power Automate is that it can take strain when working with large volumes of data.

Lengthy flows take long to save, load and execute. Large amounts of data increase the run time of flows exponentially if they aren't developed optimally. There are a few things that you could try to optimise a flow and reduce the runtime of a flow while maintaining the functionality of the solution.

![Power Automate Optimisation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## Power Automate Desktop Flows

### 1. Remove Commented (or Disabled) Code

A large part of the RPA development process includes debugging a solution while developing the functionality. Often developers comment out or disable actions instead of removing them. These could act as test harnesses (actions used purely for testing) or safety nets (often used when hoarders of code fear deleting code that previously worked).

It becomes quite easy to pollute a solution with disabled actions.

**Performance Impact**: When a PA desktop flow is run, disabled actions are read, even though they aren't necessarily executed. Removing a few disabled actions might not make a massive dent in process duration but it does make a difference.

**Best Practice**: Regularly clean up disabled actions during development reviews.

### 2. Build Business Exception Checks

When building UI Automation flows, 'Send hotkey', 'Click' and 'Get details' actions are commonly used with 'On Error' actions set up. Send hotkeys are efficient ways of executing actions to work around frequently changing user interfaces, although the 'Send hotkey' actions can often get lost between screen changes.

**The Challenge**: This could result in many issues if the automation continues when the screen state is unexpected.

**The Solution**: A good practice for UI automations would be to execute an action and check that the screen is in the correct state before submitting an action. In a case where the screen did not change as expected or that the executed action did not render the expected result, these checks could return Business or Application Exceptions and immediately end the sub-flow before proceeding to the environment clean-up phase.

### 3. Introduce Sub-flows to Group Reusable Logic

**Environment Clean-up Example**: It is a good practice to clean up an environment before and after every process run. The clean up process would refer to the termination of any applications that may be open or be used within the process.

**Modularisation Benefits**:
- Reduces code duplication
- Improves maintainability
- Enhances debugging capabilities
- Decreases overall flow complexity

By cleaning the environment, that risk is mitigated. This is just one example of logic that can be grouped by building a single clean-up sub-flow and invoking or 'running' the sub-flow at all points where it is applicable.

### 4. Ensure That 'On Error' Actions are Setup Correctly

'Clicks' and 'Get details' activities are common with UI automations. These activities come with the ability to configure 'On Error' actions. These actions allow for retries, delays, setting variables, executing specific actions and running sub-flows.

**Optimisation Strategy**:
- Ensure that the waiting time between retries is feasible
- Decrease wait times and add validation checks instead
- Group exception handling logic in sub-flows
- Configure 'On Error' to execute exception handling sub-flows

### 5. Reduce the Amount of Waits Being Used

When using a concatenation of hotkeys and clicks, waits (and wait untils) are commonly used to ensure that an application is ready for input.

**The Problem**: These waits could turn into endless loops and prolong process execution times more than is necessary.

**Better Approach**: By building in checks and limits, these process execution times could be reduced with more indicative measures of where the process encounters errors.

\`\`\`
Replace:
Wait 5 seconds → Send hotkey

With:
Wait until element exists (max 10 seconds) → Send hotkey
\`\`\`

### 6. Use Clicks Rather Than Send Hot Keys

**Performance Trade-off**: Although send hotkeys execute faster, clicks allow for more stable execution and also allow for the configuration of 'On Error' actions.

**Recommendation**: As far as possible, rather use clicks than send hotkeys when building UI automations for better reliability and error handling capabilities.

### 7. Write Input Data to Textfile

In a case where large amounts of data are being parsed through to the desktop flow from the cloud flow, consider writing the input variable contents to a text file.

**Benefits**:
- Enables unit testing of Power Automate solutions
- Allows testing Desktop and Cloud flows independently
- Reduces development and testing times
- Provides data persistence for debugging

**Implementation**: The data from the cloud flow would be written to a text file before the process is executed. If the input variables are blank, read the contents from the text files to execute the process with previous run data.

## Power Automate Cloud Flows

### 1. Remove Loops That Process Items Individually

**The Challenge**: Connectors, like the Excel connector, only allow for items to be processed on a 'line-by-line' basis. The more items that there are to process, the longer the process will take to execute.

**The Solution**: By bulk processing these items, the risk of exponentially increasing process duration is mitigated to some degree. This could be done through introducing other components, like Azure functions.

**Example Implementation**: A good example of this can be found in [this post](https://thejpanda.com/2021/09/17/azure-function-in-stream-excel-manipulation-in-c/).

**Performance Benefits**:
- Reduces API call limits impact
- Decreases process duration
- Minimises licensing costs for per-user plans
- Improves overall flow reliability

### 2. Rework Loop Levels

Power Automate cloud allows for a maximum depth of 9 levels. Scopes are really useful when grouping actions logically although they are considered to be a 'level' of 'loops' which does have an effect on execution times.

**Performance Impact**: The theory behind the [Big O notation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/) explains why this has such a significant impact on process duration.

**Best Practice**: In cases where logical validations go further down than 6 levels, it would be advised to rather set variables and process logic based on conditional variables rather than adding loops within loops.

**Avoid**: Especially when adding 'apply to each' loops within 'apply to each loops'.

### 3. Introduce Sub-flows to Group Reusable Logic

It is important that flows that are built as automation solutions have some form of exception handling and logging. These components can be built as a separate flow to group the logic of handling and logging exceptions which can be reused each time that an exception or error occurs.

**Benefits of Sub-flows**:
- Centralised exception handling
- Consistent logging practices
- Improved error reporting capabilities
- Reusable components across multiple flows

**Implementation Example**:
\`\`\`
Main Flow
├── Try Scope
│   ├── Business Logic
│   └── Process Data
├── Catch Scope
│   ├── Call Exception Handling Sub-flow
│   └── Log Error Details
└── Finally Scope
    └── Cleanup Actions
\`\`\`

## Advanced Optimisation Strategies

### API Call Optimisation
- **Batch Operations**: Use SharePoint batch operations for bulk CRUD operations
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in variables
- **Conditional Logic**: Avoid unnecessary API calls with proper validation

### Memory Management
- **Variable Scope**: Use appropriate variable scopes to reduce memory usage
- **Data Structures**: Choose efficient data structures for large datasets
- **Garbage Collection**: Clear large variables when no longer needed

### Parallel Processing
- **Concurrent Actions**: Use parallel branches for independent operations
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: Implement async processing where possible
- **Load Distribution**: Distribute work across multiple flows

## Monitoring and Performance Analysis

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Execution Time**: Monitor flow duration trends
- **Action Count**: Track the number of actions per flow
- **Error Rates**: Monitor failure patterns
- **API Usage**: Track connector usage against limits

### Performance Tools
- **Flow Analytics**: Use built-in analytics in Power Automate
- **Custom Logging**: Implement detailed logging for performance analysis
- **Third-party Monitoring**: Consider external monitoring solutions

## SharePoint Specific Optimisations

As highlighted in the comments, batch operations can significantly improve SharePoint integrations:

### Batch Operations
- **Batch Create**: Reduce API calls for bulk item creation
- **Batch Update**: Efficiently update multiple items
- **Batch Delete**: Remove multiple items in single operations

**Performance Impact**: These optimisations can cut total action API calls and flow run-times by up to one-third.

**Implementation Resources**:

- [Batch Update Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0NuYtXdcrQ)
- [Batch Delete Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ImkuGpEeoo)

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Test flows with production-level data volumes
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points and limitations
- **Baseline Metrics**: Establish performance benchmarks

### Optimisation Validation
- **Before/After Metrics**: Measure improvement from optimisations
- **User Experience**: Validate that optimisations don't impact functionality
- **Monitoring**: Implement ongoing performance monitoring

These optimisation strategies provide a comprehensive approach to improving Power Automate flow performance, ensuring efficient and reliable automation solutions that scale effectively with organisational needs.`,date:"2021-09-28",category:"Automation",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Beginner – Senior",slug:"power-automate-optimization-tips",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"16",title:"Exporting Power BI Reports as Images and Embedding into Word Documents",excerpt:"Learn how to automate the process of exporting Power BI report pages as images and seamlessly embedding them into Word documents using Power Automate.",content:`
# Exporting Power BI Reports as Images and Embedding into Word Documents

**Level of Difficulty: Beginner – Senior**

![Power Automate BI Integration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

Now, we all know that data speaks volumes, but only if we can understand its language. Power BI has been a game changer in converting complex data into insightful, visually engaging reports. But there's more magic in the mix! Have you ever tried extracting a Power BI report into an image and embedding it into a Word document? If not, let me explain why it's worth considering. The process adds a whole new dimension to presenting and sharing data. You see, by transforming your BI reports into images, we can insert them seamlessly into Word docs. This makes the data easily digestible, ensuring we're all on the same page. It's about bringing data alive in a format that's simple, portable, and best of all, doesn't require Power BI expertise to comprehend. It's like bridging the gap between data nerds and the rest of us, which is a win-win, right? So, let's dive in and find out more about this.

To get Power BI content into a Word document, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the Developer Tab has been added to the Word Toolbar
2. Add an image through the Developer Tab
3. Update the Properties
4. Create a Power Automate Flow with a defined trigger
5. Export the Power BI Report Page to an image
6. Populate the Word document with the image file content

## Add Developer Tab

Navigate to **File > Options > Customize Ribbon > Tick the Developer toolbox**

![Enable Developer Tab](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png)

Hit "OK" and navigate to the toolbox where you should see the following:

![Developer Tab Enabled](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1.png)

## Add Image Placeholder

Focus the cursor on the part of the document where the image should be added. Select the **Developer** tab and select the **Picture Content Control**.

![Picture Content Control](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2.png)

Once the image has been added, select and amend the **Properties** under the **Controls** section. Complete the **Title** and **Tag** properties:

![Content Control Properties](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-3.png)

## Create Power Automate Flow

Navigate to [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com/), then create a new instant flow (or add your required trigger). On a high-level, the flow should follow the following structure:

![Power Automate Flow Structure](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/power-bi-report-extract.png)

### Export Power BI Report to Image (PNG)

Select the Power BI Workspace and Report along with the Export Format.

![Export Power BI Report](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-4.png)

Power BI Reports are filtered using URL query parameters which are detailed in these [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-url-filters). The structure of the query follows the following format:

\`\`\`
<table name>/<column name> <operator> '<value>'
\`\`\`

### Populate the Word Document

Add the **Populate a Microsoft Word Template** action, then select the location (SharePoint, Teams or OneDrive), select the library and the file. The "Image Placeholder" will appear as the title you gave the image in the document when the picture content control was added. Assign the Power BI file content to the field.

![Populate Word Template](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-5.png)

Save and run!

## Benefits of This Approach

### Enhanced Accessibility
- **No Power BI licensing required**: Recipients don't need Power BI access to view reports
- **Offline viewing**: Word documents work without internet connectivity
- **Universal format**: Word documents are widely accessible across platforms

### Improved Collaboration
- **Consistent formatting**: Embedded images maintain visual integrity
- **Version control**: Track document changes alongside report snapshots
- **Distribution flexibility**: Easy sharing via email, SharePoint, or Teams

### Automation Advantages
- **Scheduled reporting**: Automate regular report generation
- **Template consistency**: Standardised document formatting
- **Reduced manual effort**: Eliminate copy-paste workflows

## Advanced Implementation Tips

### URL Filtering for Dynamic Reports
Use Power BI URL filters to create targeted report exports:

\`\`\`
https://app.powerbi.com/groups/{workspace-id}/reports/{report-id}/ReportSection?filter=Sales/Region eq 'North'
\`\`\`

### Multiple Report Pages
Extend the flow to include multiple report pages by:
1. Adding multiple "Export Power BI Report" actions
2. Creating corresponding image placeholders in Word
3. Mapping each export to its placeholder

### Error Handling
Implement robust error handling:
- Check if Power BI report is accessible
- Validate image export success
- Provide fallback content for failed exports

### Scheduling Considerations
- **Peak hours**: Avoid heavy automation during business hours
- **Report refresh timing**: Align with Power BI data refresh schedules
- **File size management**: Monitor and clean up temporary files

This automation bridges the gap between powerful BI insights and accessible business communication, ensuring data-driven decisions reach every stakeholder regardless of their technical expertise.`,date:"2023-07-12",category:"Digital Transformation",author:"JPanda Solutions",difficulty:"10 min read",slug:"power-automate-power-bi-word-integration",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image.png"},{id:"17",title:"Setting up a Power BI Custom Connector for UiPath Data Service",excerpt:"Learn how to create a custom Power BI connector for UiPath Data Service, enabling powerful visualisations and analytics from your automation data using Power Query.",content:`
# Setting up a Power BI Custom Connector for UiPath Data Service

UiPath Data Service has become a sophisticated way to encapsulate data and information used in automation solutions within the UiPath platform without needing to invest in additional infrastructure. The power that data enables which ties everything together is the ability to integrate and visualise the available data.

For this, UiPath relies heavily on the [UiPath Data Service activity](https://docs.uipath.com/activities/docs/about-the-dataservice-activities-pack) and the [UiPath Data Service API](https://docs.uipath.com/data-service/docs/api-access).

![UiPath Data Service Integration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## The Challenge

UiPath has a product referred to as [UiPath Insights](https://docs.uipath.com/insights/docs/about-insights) in the product suite which is aimed at building visualisations from data within the environment (currently specific to UiPath Automation Hub and UiPath Orchestrator). UiPath Insights is a good tool to use for visualisations for data that is not living in Data Service.

Unfortunately there is not an integration between Data Service and Insights just yet.

Since visualisation is an important layer used to understand the underlying data and UiPath have not yet catered for the capability, other tools and options should be considered as a 'stop gap'. The industry leading tool in this space is Microsoft's Power BI. Power BI Desktop is available for download at no cost and is a very user friendly platform used to develop reports and dashboards.

## The Solution Architecture

![UiPath Data Service Power BI Integration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/uipath-data-service-power-bi-integration.png)

In this post we'll be covering how to use a Power Query Script to connect to the UiPath Data Service API, packaged as a custom connector that can be ingested into Power BI Desktop as a data source.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Some things you may want to consider before getting started:

- Install Visual Studio 2016, 2017 or 2019. **2022 does not seem to support what we will be trying to do**
- Download and install the [Power Query SDK](https://aka.ms/powerquerysdk)
- Download the following [Power Query code sample](https://forum.uipath.com/uploads/short-url/sRx3xyHAPOH8FgnKjeRTYzI7raU.zip)
- Build the project and copy the generated UiPathDataService.mez file into your Custom Connectors directory (\`Documents\\Power BI Desktop\\Custom Connectors\`)

### Alternative Option

Alternatively, you can download the custom connector from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JacquiM/UiPath-Data-Service-Power-BI-Custom-Connector) and move it to your Power BI Custom Connectors directory.

## Create a UiPath External Application

Navigate to the [UiPath Automation Cloud](https://platform.uipath.com/) where you will need to create an External Application. To do that, go to the 'Admin' tab and navigate to 'External Applications'.

![UiPath Admin External Applications](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image.png)

Click 'Add Application' and insert the following information:

### Application Configuration
- **Type**: Non-Confidential application
- **Scopes**: \`DataService.Schema.Read\`, \`DataService.Data.Read\`
- **Redirect URL**: \`https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html\`

![Add External Application](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1.png)

## Configuring Security Settings in Power BI

When you open Power BI Desktop, you may be prompted to update your security settings before you can use the custom connector.

![Security Settings Prompt](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2.png)

To configure security:

1. Go to **File > Options > Security > Web Preview Level > Data Extensions**
2. Check the **'Allow any extension to load without validation or warning'** option
3. Restart Power BI Desktop

![Power BI Security Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3.png)

## Pulling the UiPath Data Service Data into Power BI

### Step 1: Get Data
Select 'Get Data'. Search for the 'UiPath Data Service' data source, which should appear as a custom connector:

![UiPath Data Service Connector](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png)

### Step 2: Connection Parameters
You'll be prompted to provide the following information:

- **Organisation Name**: Your UiPath organisation identifier
- **Tenant Name**: Your UiPath tenant name
- **Client ID**: App ID of the external app created in UiPath Automation Cloud

![Connection Parameters](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-7.png)

### Step 3: Select Entities
You should now be able to select the entities that you would like to use as data sources from UiPath Data Service:

![Entity Selection](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5.png)

### Step 4: Create Visualisations
Now you can go on to create powerful visualisations from the data in Power BI:

![Power BI Visualisations](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Power Query Script Structure

The custom connector uses Power Query M language to:

1. **Authenticate** with UiPath Automation Cloud using OAuth 2.0
2. **Retrieve Schema** information from Data Service API
3. **Fetch Data** from specified entities
4. **Transform Data** into Power BI compatible format

### Authentication Flow

\`\`\`m
// OAuth 2.0 authentication with UiPath
UiPath.Authenticate = (organizationName as text, tenantName as text, clientId as text) =>
    let
        authorizeUrl = "https://account.uipath.com/oauth/authorize",
        tokenUrl = "https://account.uipath.com/oauth/token",
        redirectUrl = "https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html",
        scope = "DataService.Schema.Read DataService.Data.Read"
    in
        OAuth.AuthorizationCode(authorizeUrl, tokenUrl, clientId, null, scope, redirectUrl);
\`\`\`

### Data Retrieval

\`\`\`m
// Fetch entity data from UiPath Data Service
UiPath.GetEntityData = (organizationName as text, tenantName as text, entityName as text, accessToken as text) =>
    let
        url = "https://platform.uipath.com/" & organizationName & "/" & tenantName & "/dataservice_/api/v1/entities/" & entityName & "/records",
        headers = [
            Authorization = "Bearer " & accessToken,
            #"Content-Type" = "application/json"
        ],
        response = Web.Contents(url, [Headers = headers])
    in
        Json.Document(response);
\`\`\`

The custom connector approach provides a robust foundation for UiPath data analytics, enabling organisations to leverage their automation investments through comprehensive business intelligence capabilities.`,date:"2022-08-08",category:"Business Intelligence",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Intermediate – Senior",slug:"power-bi-uipath-data-service-connector",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"18",title:"Creating a UiPath Data Services Entity Record From UiPath Studio",excerpt:"Step-by-step guide to creating and populating UiPath Data Services entities from UiPath Studio, including setup, configuration, and best practices.",content:`
# Creating a UiPath Data Services Entity Record From UiPath Studio

I recently started playing with integrating UiPath Apps, UiPath Data Services and UiPath Storage Buckets into my automations. It has been a tremendous amount of fun to see it all come together and how it all gels together.

I had a few challenges creating records in UiPath Data Services Entities from UiPath but I managed to figure it out and it turns out to be quite simple.

![UiPath Data Services](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rpa.png)

## Prerequisites: Enabling UiPath Data Services

If you cannot see the Data Services icon on the navigation menu located on the left hand side of the screen, ensure that Data Services is enabled on your tenant by directing to **Admin**, expanding your tenant and selecting **Data Services**.

![Enable Data Services](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-4.png)

## Create the Entity in UiPath Data Services

Navigate to the UiPath Data Services through the UiPath Automation Cloud and **Create New Entity:**

![Create New Entity](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-5.png)

Complete the relevant fields before clicking **Save** at the bottom right hand side of the page:

![Entity Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-6.png)

### Define Entity Fields

Click on the entity and add the appropriate fields:

![Entity Fields Setup](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-12.png)

When designing your entity structure, consider:

- **Field Types**: Text, Number, Boolean, Date, etc.
- **Required Fields**: Mark essential fields as mandatory
- **Field Length**: Set appropriate character limits
- **Default Values**: Specify defaults where applicable
- **Relationships**: Define connections to other entities

Now navigate to UiPath Studio to connect the data services and start populating the entity.

## Populating the Entity From UiPath Studio

### Step 1: Install Data Services Library

First thing's first… Install the Data Services library by clicking on **Manage Packages** in the taskbar. **Search** for the library, **install** and **save**.

![Install Data Services Package](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-7.png)

### Step 2: Connect Entity to Studio

Before we can populate the entity, we first need to connect the entity to Studio. You can do this by clicking on **Manage Entities** in the taskbar – check the entity you want to add and click **Save**:

![Manage Entities](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-10.png)

The entity will appear under **Entities** in your **Project Explorer**:

![Project Explorer Entities](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-11.png)

### Step 3: Create Entity Variable

**Create** a new variable in the **Variables** pane named 'InstrumentEntity'. You will need to reassign the variable type to the **Instrument** entity. Click on **Browse for more types** in the variable type drop down:

![Variable Type Selection](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-13.png)

### Step 4: Initialize Entity Instance

Assign the **default value** of the newly created variable, **InstrumentEntity**, to a new instance of the **Instrument** entity:

![Initialize Entity Variable](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-14.png)

### Step 5: Populate Entity Attributes

Assign the attributes of the entity to values individually:

![Assign Entity Attributes](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-15.png)

### Step 6: Create Entity Record

Drag the **Create Entity Record** activity below the assignment and configure the properties to create the record in the entity:

![Create Entity Record Activity](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-16.png)

### Step 7: Test and Verify

**Run** the file and test that the process populates the entity before further customising your process:

![Entity Record Created](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image-17.png)

## Best Practices for Entity Management

### Data Validation
Implement proper validation before creating records:

\`\`\`
Sequence: Validate Data
├── Check Required Fields
├── Validate Data Types
├── Ensure Field Length Limits
└── Business Rule Validation
\`\`\`

### Error Handling
Wrap entity operations in try-catch blocks:

\`\`\`
Try-Catch: Create Entity Record
├── Try Block
│   ├── Validate Input Data
│   ├── Create Entity Record
│   └── Log Success
└── Catch Block
    ├── Log Error Details
    ├── Handle Duplicate Key Errors
    └── Send Error Notifications
\`\`\`

### Bulk Operations
For multiple records, consider batch processing:

\`\`\`
For Each: Data Collection
├── Build Entity Collection
├── Validate Each Record
└── Bulk Create Records
\`\`\`

## Advanced Entity Operations

### Querying Entities
Use the **Query Entity Records** activity to retrieve data:

- Filter by specific criteria
- Sort results appropriately
- Limit result sets for performance
- Handle pagination for large datasets

### Updating Records
Implement update operations:

- Retrieve existing record first
- Modify only necessary fields
- Handle concurrency conflicts
- Maintain audit trails

### Deleting Records
Safe deletion practices:

- Implement soft deletes where possible
- Check for dependencies before deletion
- Maintain deletion logs
- Consider archiving instead of deleting

## Integration Patterns

### With UiPath Apps
- Display entity data in app interfaces
- Allow data entry through app forms

# Uploading Files to UiPath Storage Buckets

I recently started playing with integrating UiPath Apps, UiPath Data Services and UiPath Storage Buckets into my automations. It has been a tremendous amount of fun to see it all come together and how it all gels together.

One of my biggest frustrations, however, was getting my file uploads to the storage buckets to work. I kept getting a "403 Forbidden" error regardless of how many times I changed my properties.

![UiPath Storage Buckets](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rpa.png)

## The Solution: Permissions and Access

After trolling through the forums, I found that it is an access issue. My user on orchestrator did not have any storage bucket permissions assigned to it. I wrote [this post](https://jd-bots.com/2022/03/25/creating-a-uipath-storage-bucket-role-and-assigning-it-to-a-user/) which explains how to create a new storage bucket role and assign it to a user.

Once the permissions and access have been sorted, we can get to uploading a file to storage buckets and here's how.

## Create the Storage Bucket in UiPath Orchestrator

Remember, storage buckets are folder based, so you'll need to navigate to the appropriate **Folder** that you'd like to create the storage bucket in before navigating to **Storage Buckets** and clicking **Add storage bucket:**

![Create Storage Bucket](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-11.png)

You have an option to create a storage bucket on orchestrator (the option I'm going with for this example), connect to Azure or AWS. Provide your storage bucket information and click **Add:**

![Storage Bucket Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-12.png)

## Upload Files From UiPath Studio

Now navigate to UiPath Studio where you can create a new process or library to store the file upload. If this is a function you'll use often, across automations, consider creating a library.

Don't forget to work through the [UiPath docs](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/docs/about-storage-buckets) as well, it has some really useful info about what each of the properties represents or expects.

### Simple Configuration

This is literally all you need to configure:

![UiPath Studio Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-14.png)

## Key Components for File Upload

### Required Properties

When configuring the **Upload Files** activity in UiPath Studio, ensure you set:

1. **Bucket Name**: The name of your storage bucket
2. **File Path**: Local path to the file you want to upload
3. **Object Name**: The name/path for the file in the bucket
4. **Folder Name**: If using folder-based organisation

### Authentication Requirements

The upload activity automatically uses the robot's credentials, so ensure:

- Your robot user has proper storage bucket permissions
- The storage bucket role includes upload permissions
- The robot is associated with the correct folder context

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
Implement proper error handling around the upload activity:

\`\`\`
Try
├── Upload Files Activity
└── Log Success Message

Catch
├── Log Error Details
└── Handle 403 Forbidden specifically
\`\`\`

### File Validation
Before uploading, validate:
- File exists and is accessible
- File size within bucket limits
- File type is supported
- Target bucket exists and is accessible

### Performance Considerations
- Upload files during off-peak hours for large files
- Consider compression for text-based files
- Use appropriate timeout values for large uploads
- Implement retry logic for network issues

## Integration with Other UiPath Services

### With UiPath Data Services
Storage buckets integrate seamlessly with Data Services:
- Store file references in Data Service entities
- Use bucket files as data sources for processing
- Maintain audit trails of file operations

### With UiPath Apps
UiPath Apps can reference bucket files:
- Display uploaded files in app interfaces
- Allow users to upload files through apps
- Create file management workflows

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 403 Forbidden Error
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions
**Solution**: 
1. Check robot user permissions
2. Verify storage bucket role assignment
3. Ensure folder-level access is correct

### File Not Found Error
**Cause**: Incorrect file path or file doesn't exist
**Solution**:
1. Validate file path before upload
2. Use File.Exists() to check file availability
3. Handle relative vs absolute paths correctly

### Network Timeout
**Cause**: Large files or slow network connection
**Solution**:
1. Increase timeout values
2. Implement retry logic
3. Consider file size optimisation

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Implement least-privilege access
- Use dedicated service accounts for automations
- Regularly audit storage bucket permissions
- Monitor file access patterns

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive files before upload
- Use appropriate bucket policies
- Implement data retention policies
- Consider regulatory compliance requirements

## Sample Implementation

Here's a basic workflow structure:

\`\`\`
Main Sequence
├── Initialize Variables
│   ├── strBucketName
│   ├── strFilePath
│   └── strObjectName
├── Validate File Exists
├── Try-Catch Block
│   ├── Upload Files Activity
│   ├── Log Success
│   └── Catch Exceptions
└── Clean Up Resources
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

Once you have file uploads working:
1. Explore file download capabilities
2. Implement file versioning strategies
3. Create automated backup processes
4. Build file processing workflows
5. Integrate with external systems

This foundation opens up many possibilities for document management and data processing workflows within the UiPath ecosystem.`,date:"2022-03-24",category:"Automation",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Junior – Senior",slug:"uipath-storage-buckets-upload",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rpa.png"},{id:"20",title:"A Comparison Between UiPath and Power Automate",excerpt:"Comprehensive analysis comparing UiPath and Microsoft Power Automate across functionality, ease of use, enablement technologies, and development approaches for enterprise automation.",content:`
# A Comparison Between UiPath and Power Automate

Automation is becoming a hot topic in conversations about the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) and fifth industrial revolution (5IR). Automation is referred to as the use of technology to replace human labour or even work alongside people in some way, leading to some sort of benefits (or saving) of having automation implemented.

Automation comes in different forms, shapes and sizes with a lot of emphasis placed on Business (or Digital) Process Automation (BPA/DPA) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

![Automation Platform Comparison](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## Market Position and Maturity

While RPA is focused on mimicking a person's actions, behaviour and decisions, BPA and DPA are focused on automating business processes with specific focus on efficiency and optimisation.

**UiPath** was identified by Gartner as a leading RPA technology in 2020 and 2021 with **Microsoft** also identified as a leader in the RPA in 2021. Microsoft are positioning Power Automate and Power Automate Desktop as a technology stack that enables citizen RPA development.

![Gartner Magic Quadrant](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png)

### Timeline and Maturity

- **UiPath**: Founded in 2005 with their first desktop automation released in 2013
- **Microsoft**: First released Microsoft flow (now known as Power Automate) late in 2016

# Understanding UiPath Licensing Compared to Power Platform Licensing

As a follow-on from the post written [comparing UiPath to the Microsoft Power Platform](https://thejpanda.com/2021/09/27/automation-a-comparison-between-uipath-and-power-automate/), this post aims to unpack the different licenses and licensing strategies implemented by the two different vendors. Since both are leaders in the automation space, it is apt to understand both when evaluating the feasibility of each for the implementation of either platform within an environment.

![Automation Platform Comparison](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## High-Level Differences in Approach

Microsoft are relying heavily on utilising existing user licenses as part of the Power Platform with limited functionality. Since Microsoft dominates the market for their Microsoft 365 offering that allows users access to Word, Excel, Outlook, SharePoint, etc. it has become intertwined with their approach to drive adoption among citizen developers and allow organisations an opportunity to minimise cost to an extent.

The complexity starts to become apparent when considering how Power BI licensing differs slightly from the rest of the Power Platform licensing. A user would need some form of licensing to actually start developing processes, apps or chatbots whereas the same user could download Power BI Desktop for free and start developing reports locally. The user would only need a license when publishing a report or consuming an online report.

The UiPath licensing approach is somewhat different – UiPath is very much driven from the Automation Cloud with the inclusion of the Orchestrator which allows organisations to orchestrate all automation-related operations. On-Prem or cloud orchestration options are now included in the user and robot-specific licensing options, meaning that clients no longer need to purchase an orchestrator separately.

Users can install UiPath Studio or UiPath Studio X Community for free to play around with the functionality and understand how it all fits together. Within an organisation, users would need to download UiPath Studio/Studio X from the Automation Cloud for which they would need a license before being able to sign in. The difference between the licensed version and community version is essentially the license applied to the Automation Cloud. Users can use a community version of the Automation Cloud which has a limited lifespan of approximately three years.

## Microsoft Power Platform Licensing

Before we begin trying to understand the Power Platform licensing, let's take a look at what all is encapsulated within the Power Platform and group the different licensing approaches accordingly:

![Power Platform Components](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-3.png)

Based on the above, Power BI licensing and administration is kept somewhat separate from the rest of the Power Platform. There are multiple ways that Power Platform artefacts can be licensed – with specific focus on Power Apps and Automate flows.

### Licensing Categories

The two main categories of licensing are:

- **User-based licensing**: utilising a license already assigned to a user to interact with and create content on the Power Automate environment
- **Flow/App-based licensing**: utilising a license specifically allocated to a flow or app to create Power Automate flows

Each license is subject to limitations and restrictions in terms of connector access, AI builder access, Dataverse capacity and number of actions that can be executed in a day.

### Power Platform Licensing Comparison

| **License** | **Daily Action Limits** | **Standard Connectors** | **Premium Connectors** | **RPA Attended** | **AI Builder Credits** | **Dataverse DB** | **Dataverse File** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Power Automate per Flow Plan (5 flows/month) | 250,000/flow | ✅ Included | ✅ Included | ❌ Not Included | ❌ Not Included | 50MB | 200MB |
| Power Automate per User Plan | 40,000/flow | ✅ Included | ✅ Included | ❌ Not Included | ❌ Not Included | 50MB | 200MB |
| Power Automate per User with Attended RPA | 40,000/flow | ✅ Included | ✅ Included | ✅ 1 Bot | 5,000 | 50MB | 200MB |
| **Microsoft 365 Plan** | **6,000/flow** | **✅ Included** | **❌ Not Included** | **❌ Not Included** | **❌ Not Included** | **❌ Not Included** | **❌ Not Included** |
| Power Apps per User Plan | 40,000/flow | ✅ Included | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Included | ❌ Not Included | 250MB | 2GB |
| Power Apps per App Plan | 6,000/flow | ✅ Included | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Included | ❌ Not Included | 50MB | 400MB |

### Performance Profiles

Power Platform artefacts have different limits depending on their _performance profile_. Performance profiles are subject to the license that is being used to license a flow/user.

| **Performance Profile** | **Plans** |
|------------------------|-----------|
| **Low** | • Free<br>• **Microsoft 365 plans**<br>• All license trials<br>• Dynamics 365 Team Member |
| **Medium** | • Power Apps triggered flows & child flows<br>• **Power Automate per user Plan**<br>• Dynamics 365 Enterprise plans |
| **High** | • **Power Automate per flow plan** |

### Power BI Licensing

Power BI has multiple different licenses attached to the product – the two main license types are Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium.

| **Feature** | **Power BI Pro** | **Power BI Premium** | **Power BI Premium per capacity** |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Model size limit** | **1 GB** | **100 GB** | 400 GB |
| **Refresh rate** | **8/day** | **48/day** | 48/day |
| **Mobile app access** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Advanced AI** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **XMLA endpoint** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Maximum storage** | 10 GB/user | 100 TB | 100 TB |

### Dataverse Limitations

Every tenant with a Power Apps license gets default capacity. In addition, for each license there's additional capacity (pooled) added to the tenant.

| **Power Apps Capacity Limits** | **Per App Plan** | **Per User Plan** |
|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Dataverse Database Capacity | +50 MB | +250 MB |
| Dataverse File Capacity | +400 MB | +2 GB |

| **Power Automate Capacity Limits** | **Per User** | **Per Flow** |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Dataverse Database Capacity | +250 MB | +50 MB |
| Dataverse File Capacity | +2 GB | +200 MB |

### Licensing Recommendations

- **Business users** should use their M365 plan for citizen development
- **IT departments** should make use of per user plans, attached to service accounts/principals as well as per flow/app plans

## UiPath Plans

In order to understand UiPath's licensing approach, it is important to understand the products within the UiPath technology stack.

![UiPath Technology Stack](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-6.png)

The choice between platforms often depends on existing Microsoft investments, automation complexity requirements, and organisational structure for citizen vs. professional development approaches.`,date:"2023-01-05",category:"Automation",author:"Jacqui Muller",difficulty:"Beginner – Senior",slug:"uipath-vs-power-platform-licensing",imageUrl:"https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png"},{id:"22",title:"YouTube Playlist Monitoring Using Python",excerpt:"Learn how to monitor YouTube playlists for new items using Python and the YouTube Data API, enabling automated workflow triggers for playlist updates.",content:`
# YouTube Playlist Monitoring Using Python

There are many different workflow and automation suites/platforms available out there (some of which include IFTTT, Power Automate and Tonkean) that allow users to interact with their YouTube connector. Most of these workflows classify the functions within the connectors as either a **Trigger** or an **Action**.

A trigger would be seen as an event that "kicks off" the workflow/process, whereas an action would be an event (or a set of events) that should be executed once the workflow/process has been triggered.

![YouTube Automation with Python](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/automation-1.png)

## The Problem

Many of these workflows make use of APIs to get their triggers and actions functioning. There is one small problem though… They don't always have the predefined triggers or actions that we might be looking to use.

Platforms like IFTTT and Power Automate do not yet have a **"When an item is added to a Playlist"** trigger. Not a train smash though… In this post, we work through how to monitor a YouTube playlist for the addition of new items using Python and the YouTube Data API.

## Implementation Steps

The steps that we will be following are:

1. **Get a Developer Key**
   - Create Project
   - Create Credentials  
   - Get API Key
2. **Create the Python Script**
   - Import Python Libraries
   - Obtain Playlist ID
   - Query Playlist Items
   - Process New Items

## Deep Dive

Let's dive deeper into the steps listed above.

**Please note:** This will require a YouTube Playlist to be created if it doesn't already exist.

### Get a Developer Key

In order to use the [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3), a developer key needs to be obtained through [this portal](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

#### Create Project

You'll first need to create a project by either clicking on **"Create Project"** if you have the option, or by clicking on **"Select a Project"** proceeded by **"New Project"**:

![Create Google Cloud Project](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png)

#### Create Credentials

Once you've selected an option to create a new project, you'll be prompted to enter a name. Thereafter, you may click **"Create"**:

![Project Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png)

After the redirect, you should be focused on **"Credentials"** where you can add a new API key by selecting the **"Create Credentials"** option:

![Create API Credentials](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png)

#### Get API Key

Next, copy the API key as we will need it to get the Python script working properly:

### Create Python Script

#### Install Required Libraries

Now, let's switch to Python and install the correct libraries before we can import them:

\`\`\`bash
!pip install google-api-python-client
!pip install google_auth_oauthlib
\`\`\`

#### Import Libraries and Instantiate Variables

The following libraries should be imported:

\`\`\`python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
from oauth2client.tools import argparser
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests
import json
\`\`\`

Next, let's instantiate our first three variables needed to work with the YouTube Data API:

\`\`\`python
DEVELOPER_KEY = '<insert your API key here>'
YOUTUBE_API_SERVICE_NAME = 'youtube'
YOUTUBE_API_VERSION = 'v3'
\`\`\`

#### Obtain Playlist ID

To get familiar with how the Google documentation works, let's explore how to get a list of playlists, [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists/list), using the **"Try it"** function:

![YouTube API Documentation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6.png)

The documentation explains what parameters are required and which are optional. For the sake of getting a list of my own playlists, I added the following values before selecting **"Execute"**:

![API Parameters Configuration](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7.png)

You should receive a 200 response with information regarding your playlists:

![API Response](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png)

By selecting **"Show Code"** shown above, you should be able to select **"Python"** to see the Python Code if you wanted to add it to the automation script:

![Python Code Generation](https://thejpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9.png)

Once you have the ID of the playlist that you'd like to monitor, assign it to a variable:

\`\`\`python
playlist_id = '<insert playlist ID here>'
\`\`\`

#### Query Playlist Items

There is a max result limit of 50 results per call to the API which means that the results will need to be paged if there are more than 50 items in a playlist (multiple calls will need to be made to get all the results, 50 at a time). The response will contain a page token if there is a next page.

Now, let's create a method that allows for paging through results:

\`\`\`python
# Get all items in specified playlist
def get_playlist_items(page_token):
    # Auth with YouTube service
    youtube = build(YOUTUBE_API_SERVICE_NAME, YOUTUBE_API_VERSION,
                   developerKey=DEVELOPER_KEY)
    
    # Call the playlistItems.list method to retrieve results
    request = youtube.playlistItems().list(
        part="snippet,contentDetails",
        pageToken=page_token,
        maxResults=50,
        playlistId=playlist_id
    )
    response = request.execute()
    
    return response
\`\`\`

#### Process New Items

In the true spirit of automation workflows/processes, if the trigger is "new items found in a playlist", then we need actions to execute once that is found to be true. We can encapsulate these actions into a **"Process New"** method:

\`\`\`python
# Process any items that were not found in the previous set of results
def process_new(df_old, df_new):
    
    df_diff = df_new.set_index('title').drop(df_old['title'], errors='ignore').reset_index(drop=False)
    
    print(len(df_diff))
    
    for index, element in df_diff.iterrows():
        print("New Item Added: " + str(element['title']).encode('utf-8'))
\`\`\`

### Main Execution Logic

Let's tie the top two methods together through a **"main"** method code snippet. Make sure you have an **"items.xlsx"** file that records all of the items that are in the playlist:

\`\`\`python
isEnd = False
page_token = None
df = pd.DataFrame()  # instantiate blank dataframe

# Read history before querying new results so that new records may be identified
df_history = pd.read_excel('items.xlsx', headers=False)

while not isEnd:
    playlist_items = get_playlist_items(page_token)
    
    current_count = playlist_items['pageInfo']['totalResults']
    
    # if there is a page token, use it for the next call or assign it back to None
    if 'nextPageToken' in playlist_items.keys():
        page_token = playlist_items['nextPageToken']
    else:
        isEnd = True
        page_token = None
    
    # write playlist item information to the dataframe
    for item in playlist_items['items']:
        temp_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(item)
        temp_df = temp_df[['snippet']].transpose()
        df = df.append(temp_df)
            
df.to_excel('items.xlsx')  # write the dataframe to excel
process_new(df_history, df)  # process the new items
\`\`\`

## Advanced Implementation Features

### Error Handling

Add robust error handling to manage API limits and network issues:

\`\`\`python
import time
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

def get_playlist_items_with_retry(page_token, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return get_playlist_items(page_token)
        except HttpError as e:
            if e.resp.status == 403:  # Quota exceeded
                print(f"Quota exceeded. Waiting before retry...")
                time.sleep(60)  # Wait 1 minute
            elif e.resp.status == 404:  # Playlist not found
                print("Playlist not found.")
                return None
            else:
                print(f"HTTP Error: {e}")
                if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    time.sleep(10)  # Wait 10 seconds before retry
                else:
                    raise
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(10)
            else:
                raise
\`\`\`

### Enhanced Data Processing

Expand the data extraction to include more metadata:

\`\`\`python
def extract_video_details(item):
    snippet = item['snippet']
    content_details = item['contentDetails']
    
    return {
        'title': snippet.get('title', 'N/A'),
        'description': snippet.get('description', 'N/A')[:100],  # First 100 chars
        'published_at': snippet.get('publishedAt', 'N/A'),
        'video_id': content_details.get('videoId', 'N/A'),
        'channel_title': snippet.get('videoOwnerChannelTitle', 'N/A'),
        'thumbnail_url': snippet.get('thumbnails', {}).get('default', {}).get('url', 'N/A')
    }
\`\`\`

### Notification Integration

Add email or webhook notifications for new items:

\`\`\`python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_notification(new_items):
    if not new_items:
        return
    
    # Email notification
    smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
    smtp_port = 587
    sender_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
    sender_password = "your-app-password"
    recipient_email = "recipient@gmail.com"
    
    subject = f"New YouTube Playlist Items ({len(new_items)})"
    body = "New items added to playlist:\\n\\n"
    
    for item in new_items:
        body += f"- {item['title']}\\n"
    
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = recipient_email
    
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        server.send_message(msg)
        server.quit()
        print("Notification sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send notification: {e}")
\`\`\`

### Scheduling and Automation

Create a scheduled monitoring system:

\`\`\`python
import schedule
import time

def monitor_playlist():
    """Main monitoring function"""
    try:
        print(f"Checking playlist at {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
        # Execute your main monitoring logic here
        # ... (previous code)
        print("Monitoring complete.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during monitoring: {e}")

# Schedule monitoring every 30 minutes
schedule.every(30).minutes.do(monitor_playlist)

# Keep the script running
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
\`\`\`

## Use Cases and Applications
